# Existing Research Synthesis
## Psychological Manipulation in Marketing Discourse

---

## 1. Core Theoretical Foundations Identified

### 1.1 Psychological Targeting Framework
Based on research: **"Psychological targeting as an effective approach to digital mass persuasion"**

#### Key Findings:
- **Personality-matched advertising** significantly increases effectiveness
- Single data points (e.g., one Facebook Like) sufficient for targeting
- Extraverted vs. introverted ad styles show measurable differences in engagement

#### Application to Thesis:
- Analyze how brands adapt language for different personality profiles
- Identify linguistic markers of personality-targeted content
- Compare effectiveness across sectors

### 1.2 Emotion Manipulation Mechanisms

#### Primary Emotions in Marketing Manipulation:

| Emotion | Manipulation Strategy | Common Triggers | Sector Application |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Fear** | FOMO, aging anxiety, social rejection | "Limited time", "protect", "prevent" | High in skincare (aging fears) |
| **Guilt** | Personal inadequacy, responsibility | "You deserve better", "your skin needs" | Skincare & fitness |
| **Desire** | Aspiration, transformation promise | "Dream", "perfect", "achieve" | Luxury fashion |
| **Hope** | Future improvement possibility | "Transform", "renewal", "results" | All sectors |
| **Pride** | Status, achievement, self-esteem | "Exclusive", "elite", "success" | Luxury brands |
| **Shame** | Social judgment, inadequacy | "Hide imperfections", "fix flaws" | Skincare heavy |
| **Joy** | Positive association, reward | "Celebrate", "enjoy", "happiness" | Fashion & lifestyle |
| **Anger** | Mobilization against problems | "Fight back", "take control" | Fitness motivation |

### 1.3 Persuasion Models

#### Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM)
- **Central Route**: Logic, facts, evidence-based claims
- **Peripheral Route**: Emotions, aesthetics, celebrity endorsement

#### Self-Brand Connection
- Match between consumer identity and brand emotion
- Particularly strong in luxury fashion sector

#### Cognitive Dissonance Exploitation
- Creating tension between current and ideal self
- Resolution through purchase behavior

## 2. Manipulation Strategies Discovered

### 2.1 Language Manipulation Techniques

#### Versailles Literature (Humblebragging)
**Source**: Social media influencer research
- Modest-sounding complaints that show off wealth
- Creates negative sentiment toward luxury brands
- Straightforward bragging more effective than fake modesty

#### Embodied Resistance Concepts
**Source**: "Embodied Resistance to Persuasion in Advertising"
- Emotions are embodied (facial muscles, posture, physiological)
- Advertisements triggering positive emotions increase ideal/ought self-gap
- Cognitive reappraisal vs. expressive suppression strategies

### 2.2 Digital Manipulation Tactics

#### Parasocial Relationships
**Source**: K-Pop fan consumer behavior research
- High persuasion knowledge (PK) = less influenced by eWOM
- Low PK consumers more susceptible to influencer marketing
- Parasocial bonds override critical thinking

#### Facial Expression Influence
**Source**: Lewinski (2015a) research
- Facial expressions predict video popularity 8 months later
- Happiness and sadness expressions drive consumer behavior
- Automatic facial coding predicts advertisement effectiveness

## 3. Sector-Specific Insights

### 3.1 Luxury Fashion Sector

#### Key Papers:
- "Analysis of Luxury Brand and Consumer Psychology"
- "Corporate Branding, Emotional Attachment and Brand Loyalty"
- "Social media and luxury: A systematic literature review"
- "The Dark Side of a Big Smile: Detrimental Effects on Luxury"

#### Manipulation Patterns:
1. **Exclusivity Construction**: Limited access, VIP language
2. **Heritage Narratives**: Tradition, craftsmanship, timelessness
3. **Aspiration Triggers**: Success, sophistication, elite membership
4. **Emotional Attachment**: Personal stories, brand mythology

### 3.2 Fitness Sector

#### Key Insights:
- Self-discrepancy exploitation (actual vs. ideal self)
- Achievement narrative construction
- Body transformation promises
- Community/tribe belonging appeals

#### Manipulation Techniques:
1. **Inadequacy Amplification**: "Your current self isn't enough"
2. **Transformation Mythology**: Before/after narratives
3. **Urgency Creation**: "Summer body", seasonal pressure
4. **Social Comparison**: Influencer bodies as standards

### 3.3 Skincare/Cosmetics Sector

#### Research Focus:
- Pseudo-scientific language usage
- Authority claims (dermatologist recommended)
- Problem-solution narrative structures
- Age-related fear exploitation

#### Specific Tactics:
1. **Scientific Mimicry**: Complex ingredient names, percentages
2. **Medical Authority**: Clinical trials, doctor endorsements
3. **Problem Amplification**: Microscopic imagery of "damage"
4. **Solution Monopoly**: "Only our formula can..."

## 6. Key Research Questions Refined

Based on existing research, the thesis should address:

1. **How do manipulation strategies differ across luxury/mass market positioning?**
   - Luxury: Subtle, aspiration-based
   - Mass market: Direct, problem-focused

2. **What role does scientific authority play in manipulation?**
   - Particularly relevant for skincare
   - Pseudo-scientific language analysis needed

3. **How do brands exploit self-discrepancy?**
   - Gap between actual and ideal self
   - Sector-specific exploitation strategies

4. **What are the linguistic markers of manipulation?**
   - Urgency indicators
   - Emotional triggers
   - Authority claims
   - Social proof elements
