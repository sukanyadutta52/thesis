## 1. Research Focus

### 1.1 Research Question
**Main RQ:** How do contemporary marketing discourses employ psychological manipulation strategies to influence consumer behavior across different market sectors?

### 1.2 Sub-Questions
1. What linguistic and multimodal strategies constitute psychological manipulation in marketing discourse?
2. How do manipulation techniques vary across luxury fashion, fitness, and skincare/cosmetics sectors?
3. What are the ethical implications of identified manipulation strategies?
4. How do digital marketing channels amplify or modify traditional manipulation techniques?

### 1.3 Hypotheses

- **H2:** Fitness brands predominantly use aspiration and inadequacy triggers
- **H3:** Skincare brands leverage scientific authority and fear-based messaging
- **H4:** Cross-sector analysis reveals universal manipulation patterns
