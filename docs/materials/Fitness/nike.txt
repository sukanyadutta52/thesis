Magically Energetic Foam
Our lightweight Nike ZoomX foam cushioning uses cutting-edge engineering to give you the greatest possible energy return, turning the impact of your step into energy for your next stride.
What Is Nike ZoomX?
Nike ZoomX is lighter, softer and more responsive than any Nike foam, designed to maximize speed by delivering greater energy return. ZoomX was derived from a foam traditionally used in aerospace innovation, applied for the first time in performance footwear in the Nike Zoom Vaporfly Elite and 4%.
Lightweight Comfort
Nike ZoomX is our lightest foam, giving you more cushioning without the weight.
Highest Energy Return
The Nike ZoomX midsole delivers 85% energy return, the greatest of any Nike foam, to give you a propulsive feeling as you move forward.
Nike ZoomX Origins
When we set out to the break the two-hour marathon barrier, we knew we needed a lightweight material with an extremely high energy return. We created Nike ZoomX foam—which gave us both—by combining insight from elite runners with countless hours of biomechanical analysis. The foam first appeared in the Nike Zoom VaporFly 4%, the shoe 2016 Olympic Gold Medalist Eliud Kipchoge raced in the 2:00:25 Breaking2 marathon.
After that historic race, Kipchoge told us he wanted Nike ZoomX foam in a training shoe. As he says it, "If you want to succeed on race day, you must build your belief, every day, in practice. I wanted to feel, in every run, some of the magic I get when I race in VaporFly, to help push during training, and remember why I am pushing so hard."
Enter the Nike Zoom Pegasus Turbo, the next shoe in our lineup to feature the revolutionary Nike ZoomX foam.

You are SUBJECT to these TERMS AND MAY PURCHASE NIKE PRODUCTS if you are of legal age in your jurisdiction or if you have consent from your parent or guardian.
APPLICABILITY
These Terms of Sale (“Terms of Sale” or “Terms”) apply to your shopping, orders, purchases, and returns at NIKE-owned brick and mortar retail stores (each a “Retail Store”), and NIKE-owned digital stores that enable consumer purchases through NIKE.com, SNKRS or the NIKE app (each a “Digital Store”). Retail Stores and Digital Stores are collectively referred to in these Terms of Sale as “NIKE Stores”. These Terms of Sale create a legally binding agreement between you and NIKE Retail Services, Inc. (which we may refer to as “NIKE,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) with its headquarters and principal place of business at One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, OR 97005, USA. NIKE may revise these Terms of Sale at any time. The current Terms of Sale will be posted at NIKE.com. The Terms of Sale posted at the time you purchase products at a NIKE Store will govern that purchase. In addition to the Terms of Sale, by shopping and/or purchasing at any NIKE Store you acknowledge and agree to by bound by NIKE’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy , which are incorporated herein by this reference.
PURCHASING PRODUCTS
NO PURCHASE FOR RESALE
NIKE Stores, including any consumer rights or policies offered in NIKE Stores, are intended solely for the benefit of end consumers, and therefore purchase of products for resale is strictly prohibited. Purchase for resale means the purchase of product by someone who intends to resell the product to others (consumers, businesses or any third party). If NIKE determines that a purchase or order is intended for resale, NIKE reserves the right, in its sole discretion, and as it relates to such purchase or order, to (1) suspend the application of any NIKE policy that provides a right or benefit intended for direct to consumer purchases; and (2) take any action to hinder such purchase or order (and deter future purchases or orders), including without limitation, to restrict sales to any consumer, consumer account, or member account, cancel orders, charge restocking fees, impose purchase quantity limits, decline to issue refunds or take returns, deny access to any NIKE Store, and/or suspend or close any account.
HOW TO PURCHASE– DIGITAL STORES
To complete your purchase at a Digital Store, you must provide your full name, e-mail address, valid delivery address, and payment method to place an online order. You may need to adjust your device settings or set your browser to accept functional cookies and pop-ups in order to be able to use all the functionalities of a Digital Store, which includes designing customized items, adding items to your shopping bag and submitting your order.
When you submit an order, we will send an email acknowledging receipt of your order (“Order Confirmation”). Our acceptance of your order takes place when the products are shipped to you; we will send a second email confirming that the products have been shipped. If we are unable to supply you with a product, we will inform you of this in writing and will not process the order for that product.
OUR RIGHT TO REJECT YOUR PURCHASE OR CANCEL AN ORDER
Sale of products and fulfillment of all orders at a NIKE Store is subject to availability and our discretion in managing inventory. We explicitly reserve the right to limit, decline or reject any sales and orders for any reason, without being liable for any damage or costs other than repayment of any amount received from you in relation to such sale or order, in situations including but not limited to:

With the exception of products purchased or picked up at NIKE Stores, title and risk of loss for products purchased from NIKE pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier. Title and risk of loss for products purchased online and picked up at NIKE Retail Stores or directly purchased at NIKE Retail stores will pass to you upon your authorized receipt of those products. Title to product(s) will not transfer until full payment has been received.

SPLIT DELIVERY
We often deliver all items from a single order within a single shipment. However, due to numerous factors, products may be delivered in split shipments. We reserve the right to split the delivery of any order. If we split your order, we will notify you of our intention to do so by sending you an e-mail to the e-mail address you provided at the time your order was placed.

Upon delivery, please inspect the packaging and products for damage. If it appears that the products are damaged, please do not accept the shipment, and contact NIKE consumer services for assistance.

You may cancel any order free of charge and without giving us any reason within thirty (30) minutes from the time the order was placed. Please note that we begin processing orders placed at our Digital Stores almost immediately.

EVENTS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL
An Event Outside Our Control means any act or event beyond our reasonable control, including without limitation supply chain shortages, strikes, lock-outs or other industrial action by third parties, civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist attack or threat of terrorist attack, war (whether declared or not) or threat or preparation for war, fire, explosion, storm, flood, earthquake, subsidence, epidemic, pandemic, or other natural disaster, or failure of public or private telecommunications networks.
If an Event Outside Our Control takes place that affects the performance of our obligations under these Terms: (1) We will provide notice to you as soon as reasonably possible; and (2) our obligations under these general conditions will be suspended and the time for performance of our obligations will be extended during the time needed for resolution of the Event Outside Our Control.

MOVE TO ZERO
MOVE TO ZERO IS NIKE’S JOURNEY TOWARD ZERO CARBON AND ZERO WASTE, HELPING TO PROTECT THE FUTURE OF SPORT.
OUR PATH TO ZERO
We all share the responsibility for our playground—Planet Earth. That’s why we’re reimagining things top to bottom through sustainability and circularity. We’re focusing on carbon, waste, water, and chemistry, aiming to hit targets by 2025. Check out our Impact Report to see our progress.
2025 TARGETS
BLOOM OVER DOOM
Nike has pushed the boundaries of sustainable innovation for decades. But what got us here won’t get us where we need to go. We’re evolving the playbook, transforming science fiction to science fact, at Nike’s scale. We’re not there yet, but we know where we’re going—moving to zero and then beyond. We think of it as “Bloom Over Doom”—tenacious optimism, audacious innovation and collective action so we all, and this beautiful blue ball, thrive.
MATERIALS WITH LESS IMPACT
By reusing existing plastics, yarns and textiles, and inventing entirely new materials, we’re making big strides forward on our journey to zero carbon and zero waste.
CIRCULAR SOLUTIONS
Protecting the future of sports means rethinking how we bring products into the world, make them last and giving them new life. Learn about the services we offer, the steps we’re taking, and how you can move to zero with us.
MAKE YOUR GEAR LAST
Explore our Product Care guide for easy maintenance and care recommendations to get the most out of your favorites.
Help reduce waste by donating or recycling worn athletic shoes and apparel.
We source a mix of eligible returns and open box footwear to create an opportunity to purchase gently used shoes at a lower price.
We collect local vintage and dead stock product, using its materials to create newly designed and manufactured pieces.
TAKING ACTION, TOGETHER
Did you know? The “Sunburst” symbol was created in the 1970s as a circular option where asymmetry of the Swoosh logo didn’t work. Since then, in the same nature of our circular design philosophy, we’ve repurposed the logo. Today, when you see this logo, you see one small step in our journey to Move to Zero.

Behind the Scenes of the Vomero Plus Creation
Women led the way during the feedback process in the creation of this innovative running shoe.
You’re about to have a new favorite running shoe. For those who are fans of the Nike Vomero franchise, the company’s latest innovation will not disappoint. Introducing the Vomero Plus, whose shoe design was led by women, to encourage them to maximize their running potential.
When you think of performance footwear with maximum cushioning, words like speed and comfort may come to mind. But Nike footwear designer Jordyn Klumpp and Ashley Campbell, Nike Running Footwear Product Line Manager, wanted to evoke a different kind of emotion with the Vomero Plus. Their challenge: create a shoe that doesn’t just perform but also empowers the wearer.
You could say the inspiration for this shoe was born out of a quiet act of rebellion: “The formula? With solid science and data as our guide, we learned that creating a shoe with women top of mind would be highly successful,” Klumpp says.
You’ll notice the Vomero Plus looks different from other Nike running shoes — it doesn’t have sharp, pointy edges or features. Instead, it has a softer, more rounded appearance, making it look more inviting and accessible without compromising responsiveness. This shoe is designed for the runner who wants to put in more miles and is looking for a little more cushioning.

Women Were the Sole Focus Group
There was an urgent need for something different and more approachable for fans of the Nike Invincible line. The all-female team only had nine months to develop and create an entirely new product from scratch. What could have been a rushed process became an opportunity for innovation. The launch of the Vomero Plus would set a new standard as a shoe by women with women runners in mind.
The Dreamweaver program, a Nike project that supported more than 100 female athletes training for the Olympic Trials, helped lead the charge.
“We were thinking about a female runner who's really dedicated to logging consistent, daily miles,” says Campbell.
The group was comprised of full-time workers, parents and everyday runners. Their feedback? Lead with comfort. So, the designers followed suit.
Shaping Boldness Through Soft Features
The Vomero Plus, which comes in hot pink colorways and adorns a plush collar and tongue, is designed to feel right. How did the team achieve this? They prioritized using soft, tactile materials, giving the shoe its uniquely warm and welcoming aesthetic.
The shoe was inspired by the beloved Air Max 95. The upper of the Vomero Plus is sculpted with flowing, intentional lines that exude elegance and boldness. “I wanted these lines to feel really soft and intentional, but still have attitude,” Klumpp says.
Klumpp was adamant about self-editing some of her early sketches of the Vomero Plus that felt too aggressive. Meanwhile, Campbell ensured that the product strategy aligned with this vision — delivering a shoe that was not only visually distinct, but also functionally superior.
Together, they created something confident and eye-catching.
The result was a shoe that looked different, felt different, and boasted a unique story.
What to Expect with this Shoe
The Vomero Plus offers maximum cushioning for a smooth and comfortable run: Built with a full-length ZoomX foam midsole that has 4mm more stack-height than the Invincible 3, it produces an even softer, lighter and more responsive ride than the Vomero 18.
“You're getting a different level of softness and energy return underfoot,” Campbell says. “Having more softness and more energy return is a benefit that can help you run more and stay fresher for longer.”
Most important: It made runners feel amazing. Wear testing revealed that more cushioning translated to more miles with fewer aches. Elite athlete Jessica Hull said the shoe even helped her train more consistently.
“The Vomero Plus is a great introductory shoe for a smooth, responsive and well-cushioned ride at a wide range of paces,” says Hull, a Nike athlete and silver medalist in the 1,500 meters. “It gives new runners the ability to run anywhere at any time without concern for firm surfaces or high impact on the body."
While the shoe was designed for women, anyone can sport these comfortable and lightweight shoes. Many male testers had great feedback for this shoe, as well.
Ready to run farther with the most innovative Vomero to date? When you test drive this first-of-its-kind daily trainer, which releases on August 7, 2025, remember to take note of how you feel stride after stride.

Set Your Feet Free
Engineered for natural range of motion, Nike Free technology sets your feet free so you can run the way you’re meant to.
All Natural Movement
The Nike Free outsole has laser-siped flex grooves, which release stiffness in the foam and allow it to move as naturally as the foot does.
Barefoot-like Feel
It’s not just the minimal design and breathable upper materials—Nike Free is shaped to the anatomy of the foot so it fits like a second skin and feels like a natural extension of your body.
Fine-Tuned Flexibility
From top to bottom, flexible materials make it easy for the foot to move every way it needs to.
Nike Free Series
Behind the Design
The Nature and Science of Nike Free
Tobie Hatfield, Athlete Innovation Director and Eric Avar, VP of Innovation conducted an exhaustive series of measurements to learn how the bare foot behaved while running. It was one of the first studies of its kind, and it gave them the data they needed to officially begin design on the first Nike Free.
Nike Free hits the same barefoot benchmarks first measured in the lab: balanced heel-to-toe pressure gradients, a 33-degree toe-off angle, and a more neutral pronation pattern.
Once the study of barefoot running was complete, the team got started on the initial designs. The mission was clear: Set the 52 muscles of the feet free.
Nike Free resembles the pressure profile of the bare foot much more closely than traditional footwear.
“
They can get any shoes they want, and they want to run barefoot!
Tobie Hatfield, one of the designers of the first Nike Free, after observing an elite track and field team training barefoot.
Nike Free Scale
Nike Free always helps enhance your body’s natural motion, but the barefoot-like-running experiences vary from shoe to shoe. These variances are graded on the Free Scale. The lower the number, the more barefoot-like the shoe.
Lightweight. Breathable. Supportive.
Nike Flyknit technology uses high-strength fibers to create lightweight uppers with targeted areas of support, stretch and breathability.
Nike Flyknit Technology
Inspired by our most common feedback from runners, Nike engineered a fabric that fits like a sock, with the support and durability for sport.
What is Nike Flyknit
A material made up of strong yet lightweight strands of yarn that have been woven into a one-piece upper, securing an athlete’s foot to the shoe platform.
How Nike Flyknit Works
Different types of knit patterns are used within a single Flyknit upper. Certain areas have a tighter weave to give the foot more support, while other areas are designed to be more flexible or breathable. Data from Nike’s 40+ years of studying the foot determines where each pattern is applied.
Shop Nike Flyknit
Breathable construction and targeted support help you tackle your longest distance.
Integrate areas of stretch and support where you need it most.
Excellent touch, control and striking power thanks to a sock-like fit.

Welcome to the NIKE community!
PLEASE READ THESE NIKE TERMS OF USE (“TERMS”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING ANY NIKE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OR PARTICIPATING IN ANY NIKE EXPERIENCES.
These Terms apply to the NIKE websites, social media platforms, and mobile apps (the “Platform”); the digital experiences, membership program(s), and other services accessible through or enabled by the Platform (together with the Platform, the “Services”); the footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and other products sold or otherwise provided by NIKE (“Products”); and the experiences and events hosted by NIKE or in NIKE stores (“Experiences”).
These Terms create a legally binding agreement between you and NIKE regarding your use of Services and Products and your participation in Experiences. If you live in any of the following countries or regions, additional or alternative provisions of these Terms (set forth below) may apply to you: Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Canada , Colombia , Hong Kong , Indonesia , Japan , Philippines , Thailand , Vietnam , and all European countries (including specific terms for Austria , Belgium , France , Germany , Hungary , Italy , Netherlands , Poland , Spain , Switzerland , and the United Kingdom ). Additionally, in certain countries and regions, NIKE.com, SNKRS.com, and/or the NIKE app may be operated by a third party on NIKE’s behalf, in which case such third party’s terms and conditions will apply to your use of those platforms in such countries or regions.
When we say “ NIKE ,” “ we ,” “ us ,” or “ our ,” we are referring to the NIKE entity responsible for providing the Services, Products, or Experiences in your country or region. Please review our List of Local Entities for the NIKE entities responsible for providing the Services, Products and Experiences to you. You enter into these Terms with each applicable NIKE entity.
Updates
We may update these Terms from time to time. The “date of last revision” above indicates when these Terms were last updated. If we make updates, we may also send you a notification. Unless we indicate otherwise, updated Terms will be effective immediately upon posting and your continued use of the Services, purchase of additional Products, or participation in Experiences will confirm your acceptance of the updates.
Supplemental Terms
We may indicate that different or additional terms, conditions, guidelines, policies, or rules apply in relation to some of our Services, Products, or Experiences (“ Supplemental Terms ”). Any Supplemental Terms become part of your agreement with us if you use the applicable Services, Products or Experiences, and if there is a conflict between these Terms and the Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms will control for that conflict. See the Section titled Alternative and Additional Terms for more information.
By purchasing a Product from us, you also agree to the Terms of Sale that apply in your country or region. The Terms of Sale are Supplemental Terms. For information about how to return Products, see the Return Policy that applies in your country or region.

Content is part of the Services, and you may only use the Services as expressly permitted by these Terms. NIKE reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in these Terms.
The NIKE name, the Swoosh design, our other logos, product or service names, slogans, and the look and feel of the Products and Services are trademarks, service marks, trade dress, or trade names owned or licensed by NIKE, and may not be copied, imitated, or used, in whole or in part, without our prior written permission. You do not acquire a license or any ownership rights to any trademarks, service marks, or trade names through your access or use of the Services. Do not change, obscure, or delete any ownership or proprietary notices appearing in the Services, including materials downloaded or printed from the Services.
License to Use
Subject to your compliance with these Terms, NIKE grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use our Services for your own personal, noncommercial use and, solely with respect to any applications included as part of the Services, to install and use such applications on Devices that you own or control. Any applications included in the Services are licensed (not sold), and if you fail to comply with any of the terms or conditions of these Terms, you must immediately cease using the Services and remove (uninstall and delete) applications included as part of the Services from your Devices.
Content You Submit
Some parts of the Services may allow you and other users to create, post, store, share, or otherwise provide content including photos, videos, and text (“ User Content ”). NIKE is not responsible for User Content. Except for the license you grant NIKE below, as between you and NIKE, you retain all rights in and to your User Content, excluding any portion of the Services included in your User Content.
You grant NIKE and its subsidiaries and affiliates a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide and fully paid license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, publicly or otherwise perform and display, and exploit your User Content, including the likeness of any person that appears in the User Content and any of the concepts or ideas contained in the User Content, for any purpose, including commercial uses, in all media formats and channels now known or later developed without compensation to you or any third party.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby irrevocably waive any “moral rights” or other rights with respect to attribution of authorship or integrity of materials regarding your User Content that you may have under any applicable law or under any legal theory.
Right to User Content
You represent and warrant that your User Content, and our use of such User Content as permitted by these Terms, will not violate any rights of any person or entity, including any third-party rights, or cause injury to any person or entity.
We typically do not review unsolicited suggestions, ideas, feedback, or other materials that you post, submit, or otherwise communicate to us about NIKE or our Services, Products, or Experiences (collectively, “ Feedback ”). However, any Feedback you send us is provided on a non-confidential basis and you grant NIKE and its subsidiaries and affiliates a license to use such Feedback for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without compensation or acknowledgement to you, including, but not limited to, for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, and marketing products and services.
We’re excited to have you contribute to the NIKE community. However, you are solely responsible for your conduct while using our Services or Products or participating in our Experiences and you must comply with the following rules:
Be Yourself. Do not impersonate or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with any person or organization, including athletes or NIKE employees. Only interact with the Services as yourself for personal, non-commercial purposes. This means that you may not:
Be Original. Do not create, post, store, or share any User Content if you do not have all the rights necessary to grant us the license described above.
Be Safe. Take precautions when interacting with other users (including users you do not know) on the Services. Before you meet another user face-to-face, consider investigating, bringing a friend, choosing public locations and letting someone know where you will be.
Be Considerate. Do not do anything that may expose NIKE or its users to any type of harm. This means that you may not:
Be Respectful. You may only use the Services for their intended and authorized purposes. This means that you may not:
Be Appropriate. Respect the community and do not post User Content, link to a website, or do anything that is illegal, misleading, malicious, harassing, inaccurate, discriminatory, or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate or which violates any applicable laws.
NIKE has the right to prescreen, monitor, or remove User Content. However, enforcement of this Section is solely at NIKE’s discretion, and failure to enforce this Section in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce it in other instances.
NIKE has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances, the accounts of users found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that any Content on the Services infringes a copyright that you own or control, you may provide us with written notification at the address set forth below. Please see Section 512(c)(3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“ DMCA ”) for the requirements of a proper notification. If your complaint fails to provide everything specified in the DMCA, we may be unable to act on it.
Please consult your legal advisor before filing a notice of copyright infringement with us because there may be penalties for false claims.

From time to time, NIKE may link to, provide information about, partner with, or allow you to connect your NIKE account with third-party websites, social media platforms, mobile apps, and other products, services, and experiences (“Third Parties”). You may be able to connect with these Third Parties through the Services or Products, or at Experiences, but this does not mean NIKE endorses, monitors, or has any control over these Third Parties or their activities. We provide information about and links to Third Parties as a service to those interested in such content. NIKE is not responsible for the content, policies, or activities of Third Parties and you interact with Third Parties at your own risk .
The Services and Experiences may include features that provide information about physical activity, nutrition, or general wellness or provide opportunities to engage in physical activity. Content and information provided through the Services and at Experiences are provided for educational and informational purposes only and are not intended as medical advice. The Services and Products are not medical devices and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any illness, metabolic disorder, disease, or health problem.
Before using the Services or Products as part of any exercise program or participating in an Experience, consider the risks involved and consult with a medical professional. Consulting a medical professional before beginning an exercise program is especially important if you are overweight, pregnant, nursing, or diabetic or have a heart condition, any injuries, disabilities, or other medical conditions. There are potentials for injury and other dangers associated with any physical or recreational activity, and you should not engage in any such activities that pose a heightened risk to you in light of your health conditions. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of content and information provided through the Services or at Experiences.
You should start any physical activity slowly, take care not to exceed your capabilities, and immediately stop if you become dizzy, dehydrated, or your body’s ability to function normally is otherwise affected. If you experience a medical emergency, stop using the Services and Products or participating in the Experience and consult with a medical professional. You must also take appropriate precautions while using the Services or Products or participating in Experiences and monitor your surroundings (e.g., traffic, crowds, and hazards). YOU ASSUME THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES THAT YOU ENGAGE IN.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to and will indemnify and hold harmless NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates and each of its and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents, distributors, representatives, contractors, licensors, suppliers, successors, assigns, and insurers, and all Experience sponsors, advertisers, volunteers, staff, and owners or lessors of premises used in connection with an Experience (individually and collectively, the “ NIKE Parties ”) from and against all claims, losses, liabilities, expenses, damages and costs, including attorneys' fees, arising from or relating in any way to (i) your access to or use of the Services or Products; (ii) your access to or participation in Experiences; (iii) your User Content or Feedback; or (iv) your violation of these Terms, any law or the rights of any third party (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights). The NIKE Parties will have control of the defense or settlement, at the NIKE Parties' sole option, of any third-party claims. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between you and NIKE or the other NIKE Parties.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you, for yourself and on behalf of your heirs, estate, insurers, successors, and assigns, hereby fully and forever release and discharge the NIKE Parties from any and all claims or causes of action you may have for damages arising from or relating to these Terms, the Services, Products, or Experiences. If you are a consumer who resides in California, you hereby waive your rights under California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”
Your use of our Services and Products and your participation in Experiences, and any content or materials provided therein or therewith is at your sole risk. Except as otherwise provided in a writing by us and to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, our Products, Services, Experiences and any content or materials provided therein or therewith are provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” without any representation or warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory. We aren’t making any promises of any kind, and NIKE disclaims all warranties with respect to the foregoing, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. NIKE does not represent or warrant that our Products, Services, Experiences, or any content provided therein or therewith are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free, that access to our Services or any content provided therein or therewith will be uninterrupted, or that any defects will be corrected. While NIKE attempts to make your use of our Services safe, we cannot and do not represent or warrant that our Services or any content provided therein or therewith, or our servers are free of viruses or other harmful components or content or materials. NIKE is not responsible for any damage to your Device resulting from accessing the Services, for your interactions with other users of the Services or other Experience participants, or for any damage or harm you may experience because of these interactions. You assume the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Products, Services, and Experiences and any content provided therein or therewith. All disclaimers of any kind (including in this Section and elsewhere in these Terms) are made for the benefit of NIKE and the other NIKE Parties. We hope you enjoy and get the full benefit of the Services, Products, and Experiences; however, we do not guarantee any results. The foregoing disclaimer of warranty does not apply to any product or manufacturer warranty expressly offered by NIKE and/or any third-party manufacturer of Products.
NIKE may terminate or modify all or part of any Services, including member programs, Product offerings, and Experiences at any time without notice. All modifications and additions to the Services, Product offerings, and Experiences will be governed by these Terms, unless otherwise expressly stated by NIKE in writing.
NIKE may terminate or suspend your account, delete your profile or any of your User Content, and restrict your use of all or any part of the Services or your ability to participate in Experiences at any time and for any reason, without any liability to NIKE, subject to applicable law.
These Terms remain in effect even after your account is closed, terminated, or suspended or you have otherwise stopped using the Services and stopped participating in Experiences.
In addition to these Terms, additional terms and conditions, including the following Supplemental Terms, may apply to your use of certain Services or Products, or participation in Experiences:
Applicable Law
Any disputes, claims, controversies, or legal proceedings arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Products, Services, or Experiences (each a “ Claim ”) will be governed by and in all respects construed and enforced in accordance with Oregon law, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of Oregon or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply.
Venue
Except where prohibited by applicable law, and without limitation to any statutory rights for consumers, all Claims shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action or any other kind of representative proceeding, and exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Multnomah County, Oregon, USA. You and NIKE waive any objection to venue in any such courts.
Time to Bring a Claim
To the extent permitted by law, a Claim must be brought within one (1) year after the Claim arises; otherwise, the Claim is permanently barred, which means that you or NIKE will no longer have the right to assert that Claim against the other.
Export Restriction
You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Products, Services or related technology or any content contained therein, except as authorized by export control and sanctions laws of the United States and any other government having jurisdiction. In particular, but without limitation, the Products and Services and the technology and the content contained therein, may not be exported or re-exported to (i) any U.S. sanctioned or embargoed countries or regions; or (ii) any person or entity on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals, the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person’s List or Entity List, or other U.S. sanctions or export control lists.
Electronic Communications
By using the Services, purchasing Products, or participating in Experiences, you agree to receive certain electronic communications from NIKE, subject to applicable law. Communications and transactions between NIKE and you may be conducted electronically.
Assignment
NIKE may assign its rights and duties under these Terms, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without notice to you, unless notice to you is required by applicable law, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these Terms. You cannot assign your rights and duties under these Terms, and any attempted assignment in violation of this sentence is void.
Waiver
NIKE’s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of these Terms is not a waiver of any of these Terms or NIKE’s rights. You should always assume these Terms apply.
Severability
If any provision in these Terms is held unlawful, invalid, or unenforceable for any reason, including because it is found to be unconscionable, then (i) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms; (ii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of these Terms; and (iii) the unenforceable or unlawful provision may be revised to the extent required to render these Terms enforceable or valid, and the rights and responsibilities of the parties will be interpreted and enforced accordingly, so as to preserve these Terms and the intent of these Terms to the fullest possible extent.
Intended Beneficiary
Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
Section Headings
The Section headings in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Use of the word “including” will be interpreted to mean “including without limitation.”

Celebrating 40 Years of Force
From musicians to artists to streetwear icons, the Air Force 1 has always been more than a sneaker. Everywhere it’s gone, it’s changed the game. But the past 40 years are behind us, so let’s set the stage for the next 40. Because Force has always been strongest when we do it together.

Communities of Force
Every square foot of pavement is a dance floor for this tight-knit and growing community.
Creating opportunity for the next generation of dancers, Tarryn Alberts and So Dope are making a difference in Johannesburg.
See how this crew comes together to show Japan — and the world — how they express themselves.
Out in Los Angeles, this all-female collective is fostering an empowering community that goes way beyond the dance floor.
The journey of discovering possibilities is fueled by Da-Ting and Lit Hip Hop, bringing the charm of their hometown to places far and beyond.
Join Forces Pack
Shop The Collection
A Classic Since 1982
Designed by Bruce Kilgore and introduced in 1982, the Air Force 1 was the first ever basketball shoe to feature Nike Air technology, revolutionizing the game and sneaker culture forever. Over three decades since its first release, the Air Force 1 remains true to its roots while earning its status as a fashion staple for seasons to come.
History of Air Force 1
To celebrate 40 years of Force, the Join Forces Pack and campaign highlighted not just iconic details of four decades of AF 1, but also the communities that took Force further than we could ever have dreamed.
Tapping five collaborators to recreate the white-on-white AF-1, the AF-100 collection brings five instantly coveted AF-100 designs. Among them is a unique take by Virgil Abloh, who spun-up an iteration of his AF-1 first released as part of “The Ten” Collection.
Three decades after the original, Lunar Force 1 emerges, featuring lightweight Lunarlon cushioning built into the iconic Air Force 1 design.
Air Force 1’s popularity among globally influential rappers and artists propels it farther beyond sport and into culture. For the new millennium, Roc-a-Fella Records is presented with a timeless, white-on-white edition featuring the label’s embroidered logo.
Around events and holidays, Nike introduces limited, special and premium editions that turn the Air Force 1 into collector gold overnight. The sneaker is catching on faster than retailers can keep it on the shelves.
Select retailers began exploring the concept of releasing one-off Air Force 1 designs. Every release is a hit and immediately sells out. Sneaker culture grows from Baltimore along the entire East coast as fans seek out new drops.
A trio of retailers in Baltimore re-introduce the AF-1 in royal blue and chocolate brown colorways, and all 3,000 pairs sell out almost as soon as they hit the shelves. No longer just for basketball, the sneaker takes the streets by storm. [Shoes in photo are re-releases from 2015]
The high-top AF-1 is worn by Nike’s top NBA players of the era: Michael Cooper, Bobby Jones, Moses Malone, Calvin Natt, Mychal Thompsen and Jammal Wilkes.
The Nike Air Force 1 becomes the first basketball shoe to bring soft, springy Nike Air cushioning to the game.

Space Hippie is an exploratory footwear collection inspired by life on Mars—where materials are scarce and there is no resupply mission. Created from scraps, or “space junk,” Space Hippie is the result of sustainable practices meeting radical design.
Get to know the team (and the science) behind Space Hippie, and see how we’re sourcing, making and redefining our goals behind the products we design.
Fit For Every Athlete*
Each of Space Hippie’s four silhouettes provide a unique fit option— traditional laces, lace-less and Flyease—for the lifestyle of city athletes* on -the-go.
Be among the first to know when the Nike Space Hippie Collection drops.
Each of Space Hippie’s four silhouettes provide a unique fit option—traditional laces, lace-less and Flyease—for the lifestyle of city athletes* on-the-go.
Made with Space Waste Yarn
One athlete's trash is another’s treasure. Space Hippie’s Flyknit yarn is made from 85-90% recycled content, including plastic bottles, t-shirts and post-industrial scraps.
Crater Foam tooling uses about 12% Nike Grind rubber combined with foam materials for a more sustainable, lightweight and responsive feel during city exploration.
We’re working to ditch the double box, and ship Space Hippie shoes in a single shoebox made with at least 90% recycled content.
Our apparel teams carried this inspiration into their design and turned 100% recycled content into Space Waste Yarn to create the Space Hippie tee.
A Radically Different Future
Protecting the future of sport starts with reimagining the ways in which we create the products we love the most. Space Hippie is Nike’s latest step toward a better future, but we must work as a team to move the world toward climate action.

Nike React foam is nothing short of revolutionary, thanks to its ability to be incredibly responsive and soft. Now, we’re using it to help reach our newest goal: To reduce running-related injuries. And The Nike React Infinity Run, which was designed to help reduce injuries, is the first step toward that north star. With 24% more React foam than Nike Epic React Flyknit 2, it has a wider base to provide more stability and a distinct “rocker” shape to roll you through a fluid foot strike. Scroll to learn more about what makes React foam so unique.
Introducing the Nike React Infinity Run
Designed to Help Reduce Injury
It’s Incredibly Versatile
When we released our first shoe with Nike React foam in June 2017, we knew it was groundbreaking. But no one at Nike could have predicted how versatile React foam would prove. You can find it now in shoes that range from basketball and running to golf and training. It even adds more comfort to our most stylish sportswear shoes.
Our Most Complete Foam
Responsive. Durable. Soft. Lightweight. “Historically, cushioning innovations might deliver big leaps in one or maybe two aspects of performance,” says Nike’s Ernest Kim, Advanced Director, Global Running Footwear. “But with Nike React, we see significant advancements in all dimensions of cushioning: impact attenuation, energy return, lightweight, and durability. That’s why we call it our most complete foam ever.”
Seriously Durable
A tricky thing about foam: It’s very rare that you get cushioning that’s soft and durable. It’s usually one or the other because those qualities are opposites. But Nike React technology is different. It stayed strong and soft after serious machine testing that mimicked the forces of longtime use.
Lightweight and Soft
We figured out a way for this foam to be soft, but not at the expense of being heavy. We combined polymers—Thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) and Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA)—to achieve this truly special effect.
Learn More About The Science Behind the Nike React Infinity Run
To see if the shoe could help reduce injury compared to our motion control shoe, we commissioned a study through the British Columbia Sports Medicine Research Foundation where runners followed a 12-week variable training program ending in a half marathon. Based on the results, we think we’re on the right track: In testing*, the Nike React Infinity Run showed a 52 percent lower injury rate compared to the Nike Structure 22, our leading motion control shoe. Watch Nike Sports Research Lab’s Matt Nurse explain the design and testing of this shoe.
*The Nike React Infinity Run reduced running injuries by 52% compared to the Nike Air Zoom Structure 22 in a study of 226 men and women during a 12 week run training program (injury = missing 3 or more consecutive runs due to running related pain). Our study found that 30.3% of Nike Air Zoom Structure 22 runners experienced an injury but only 14.5% of Nike React Infinity Run runners experienced an injury.
