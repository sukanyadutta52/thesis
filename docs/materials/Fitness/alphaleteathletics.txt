Who are we
At Alphalete, growth drives everything we do. We believe in raising the standardâ€”not just for the brand, but for ourselves. That means showing up with purpose, challenging the norm, and constantly looking for ways to evolve together. Weâ€™re a team that moves with clarity and intention. Weâ€™re proud of what weâ€™ve built, but even more focused on whatâ€™s ahead. If you're driven by progress and want to contribute to something thatâ€™s always moving forward, youâ€™ll thrive here.
OUR CULTURE
We donâ€™t talk about cultureâ€”we show it in how we work, how we lead, and how we grow. We believe in showing up, doing the work, and pushing for better. Our culture is shaped by people who hold themselves to a high standardâ€”not because they have to, but because they want to.
We look for people who take initiative, follow through, and lift others up along the way. If youâ€™re looking for a place where hard work is valued, ideas are welcomed, and growth is part of the everyday, we are the team you've been looking for.
Benefits
At Alphalete, we believe that the well-being of our team is essential to our success. Thatâ€™s why we offer a comprehensive benefits package designed to support every aspect of your health, growth, and lifestyle. From top-tier medical, dental, vision, and life insurance coverage, to PTO, a free gym membership, and full access to Alphalandâ€™s world-class facilitiesâ€”including multiple gyms, basketball courts, a football/soccer field, and private workout studiosâ€”weâ€™ve got you covered physically, mentally, and financially. But we donâ€™t stop there. Our team enjoys a generous clothing allowance, plus exclusive complimentary pieces from every launchâ€”so youâ€™ll always feel confident and on-brand. Our spacious HQ fosters creativity and collaboration, with an environment designed for you to thrive. Youâ€™ll also enjoy employee discounts at our in-house restaurant, making it easy to fuel your goals with delicious, health-conscious meals. Weâ€™re more than just a workplaceâ€”weâ€™re a community dedicated to helping you reach your full potential. Join us, and letâ€™s build something incredible together.
About Us
Alphalete was founded on the belief that growth is more than a goal. It's a mindset. From the beginning, we've been committed to raising the standard in everything we do. We create premium products, build real relationships, and keep challenging ourselves to evolve.
Our original mission - Learn More. Dream More. Be More. - still lives in everything we do today. We've grown a lot since those early days, but that hunger for progress has never changed. We're proud of where we started and even more focused on what's next.
We're intentional with the way we create, and even more intentional with how we connect. It's not just about what we put into the world. It's about how we show up for our community and for each other. The work we do is designed to move people forward - through quality, meaning, and shared momentum.
This isn't just a brand. It's a movement. One fueled by discipline, built with purpose, and driven by people who never settle. From the products we launch to the experiences we create, this is only the beginning.
