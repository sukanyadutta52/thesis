TAKING HEARTFELT STEPS
From a company-wide initiative to show out in the 2024 Boston Heart Walk®, to a $57,400.91 donation to the organization’s Life Is Why™ Campaign, Reebok is committed to saving lives in support of the American Heart Association®.
Q: Hey Scott, thanks for chatting with us today. Before we dive in, could you tell us a little about yourself and your role at Reebok?
A: I’m the General Manager of Reebok USA, which means I oversee the brand and commercial elements of the business here in the States. But I’ve worked at Reebok for 27 years now, and have focused on product management, including running, training and classic shoes as well as on apparel. I’m an avid sports fan—both watching and playing—and still make sure to walk 6-8 miles daily, play soccer weekly and bike periodically to stay fit. I also enjoy reading—especially on the beach during vacation!
Q: In your words, what does the American Heart Association do? And what's the Heart Walk?
A: The American Heart Association brings focus and support to one of the primary medical challenges impacting our nation, heart and brain health. Their fundraising and awareness impacts communities with added funding for research, as well as awareness and education initiatives.
The Heart Walk is the American Heart Association’s largest community-facing initiative that raises critical funds to advance lifesaving research. Through fundraising and community education, the Heart Walk aims to enhance CPR training, increase bystander preparedness, increase funding for vital research and ultimately, save lives.
Q: How did you (and Reebok) get involved with the American Heart Association?
A: Roughly eighteen months ago, Reebok was looking for a compelling brand to support and to help encourage more people to get walking, so we approached the organization to work together. At Reebok, we champion movement for all, and the American Heart Association was the perfect organization to help us reach more people with a message of encouragement to get moving and walking on a path to a healthier lifestyle. We also know that giving our employees a purpose is important. Our relationship with the American Heart Association provides both our employee and customer base a way to show that they are making a difference.
But on the personal side, I already had an affinity for the American Heart Association. Like so many of us, my primary risk factor for developing heart health issues is hereditary. When I was young, my uncle passed away while doing a stress test. And then in the 1980s, my father also had a heart attack that he was thankfully able to recover from with bypass surgery. He continues to live a relatively healthy life and is a current pickleballer at 79 years of age.
More recently, I had my own experience just a couple of years ago where I had to undergo quadruple bypass surgery. Today, I have a great prognosis and no limitations, primarily due to the awareness and availability of the best healthcare in the world that we have here in Boston—and due to efforts of organizations like the American Heart Association.
Q: Can you speak more about Reebok’s involvement in the 2024 Boston Heart Walk? What’s the walk plan?
A: To demonstrate full company support of the American Heart Association, Reebok is participating in the 2024 Boston Heart Walk as a company team. This year, our team raised $57,400.91, making us #2 out of 45 participating companies. The engagement level has been strong across so many within the organization and is a big part of how I view success. I personally committing to raising $10,000, so all in all, I’m extremely proud of our achievements. The 2024 Boston Heart Walk takes place on Saturday, October 26, 2024 with both 1-mile and 3-mile routes. The event opens at 9 AM and the walk begins at 10:30 AM at Boston Common, 1 P Charles Street, Boston, MA 02116. You can register to walk at this signup page.
Q: So then, how did you get involved as Chairman of this year’s Boston Heart Walk?
A: When meeting with the American Heart Association to develop the relationship between them and Reebok, they asked for my leadership help support the walk and spread the word, and I said ‘certainly.’ When I was formally nominated for the chairman role, I accepted without hesitation. This was an opportunity for me to participate in a significant way with something that is meaningful, and I have found the experience really rewarding and insightful. It has allowed me to think beyond my ‘day to day’ and more about my ability to impact larger community at a deeper level. It also helps to foster connections with other business leaders with similar challenges, as well as value. I’m also incredibly grateful to several people here at Reebok that have taken this initiative to heart as well.
Q: Can you describe the importance of walk events and how they contribute to the American Heart Association's overall mission?
A: Walks raise the level of awareness and bring the larger community together, which speaks to the importance and engagement that’s needed to continue to make progress. It also makes these challenges seem shared vs isolated for those impacted which can be helpful many living with, at risk of or fighting heart health issues. It’s a way to rally around and fundraise for a widespread cause that many may care about but may not necessarily know how to get involved with.
Q: How else is Reebok supporting the American Heart Association this year?
A: For every pair of Walking Shoes sold from October 8, 2024 to December 31, 2026 on reebok.com and in Reebok retail stores, Reebok will donate $1.00 of the purchase price to the American Heart Association’s Life Is Why™ Campaign, with a minimum donation commitment of $425,000 and a maximum amount of $700,000. Our goal is for consumers to know they’re supporting a good cause with their purchase. This initiative supports the Association’s life-saving mission while encouraging more people to live healthier, longer lives by staying active.
Also, earlier in May, Reebok HQ hosted an executive leadership breakfast with about 50 executives from various local companies. The goal of the breakfast is for the American Heart Association to showcase the work they have done in the Boston community, hear from survivors and inspire the executives to make a difference in the lives of those around them by ultimately joining the American Heart Associate with a sponsorship, engaging their employees with the Heart Walk Campaign or participating in some other way. I even got to speak about my experience with heart issues and my passion for the cause.
Q: To sum it up, what makes you excited about working with the American Heart Association?
A: I’m excited about supporting a cause that has a personal connection to me, while at the same time reflecting our brand value of promoting movement. I’ve gained so much more awareness on health and wellness too—the work the American Heart Association does impacts so many because heart health impacts so many. The progress that’s been made in made in treatment and care over a couple of generations is truly remarkable thanks to this organization. And, the opportunity to do this with family, friends and colleagues makes it all the more rewarding.
Through Reebok’s commitment to this relationship, our company will be able to give our customers the opportunity to be a part of raising lifesaving funds for the American Heart Association, while also becoming educated on this critical mission.
