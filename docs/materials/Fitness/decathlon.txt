RCR Pro Frame Kit
The RCR Range The RCR lineup is built for cyclists who refuse to compromise. Every tube’s cross-section is engineered for optimal efficiency in key wind angles (-15° to +15°).
This "lightweight aero" bike strikes the perfect balance of weight, stiffness, and aerodynamics—delivering an exceptional ride. If you're looking for a race-winning machine, the RCR is it.
RCR vs. RCR Pro: What Sets Them Apart? The Van Rysel RCR and RCR Pro share the same aggressive race geometry, but the difference comes down to carbon technology. The RCR uses high-modulus carbon for a stiff, efficient ride that delivers speed and responsiveness. The RCR Pro takes it further with super high-modulus carbon, reinforcing key stress points while shedding weight for an even more explosive feel. Designed for elite-level racing, the RCR Pro frame is the same one used by Decathlon AG2R’s WorldTour riders.
A Closer Look at the Frame
Lighter than the World Tour frameset, the RCR Pro’s raw, unpainted carbon construction saves about 50 grams—offering the same elite-level performance with a minimalist finish for those chasing every possible advantage.
Never clamp a carbon frame (top tube, seat tube, down tube) in a work stand or bike rack—carbon is rigid but vulnerable to compression.
Position RCR Carbon Seatpost features a -15mm offset for an aggressive riding position.
Seat Post Length by Size:
Which Size? Refer to the bike frame geometry table for precise sizing.
If you're between sizes, choose based on your riding style and fit preference. For best results, we recommend a professional bike fit.

Aerodynamics
Maximizing speed isn’t just about going faster—it’s about maintaining performance with less effort. That’s why we used CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) optimization, in partnership with ONERA, a global leader in the field, to sculpt the most aerodynamic frame design possible.
Lightweight Performance
Weight optimization is the second fundamental pillar of the RCR’s performance, and it has been at the core of its design.
Through topological analysis, we strategically removed material from targeted areas—not just on the frame, but across ancillary components as well.
This precision approach ensures every part is as light as possible, making the RCR a true racing machine.
Stiffness
The RCR was built for maximum energy return, delivering an incredible sense of propulsion with every pedal stroke.
To achieve this, we went to Japan to source the world's finest carbon fibers, ensuring the highest level of performance.
By carefully positioning these fibers in key areas, we enhanced stiffness, allowing the RCR to channel every ounce of your effort like no other bike before it.
DIVE DEEPER
Developed in collaboration with the French Office National d'Études et de Recherches Aérospatiales (ONERA), the RCR makes no compromises.
It is designed for a single purpose: to win.
