Defining My Skin Type
Wash off all dirt, make up, and impurities from your face, and pat dry. Do not apply any products, and wait for 30 minutes. You can determine your skin type based on the descriptions below.
Your skin feels balanced and hydrated — not tight and not oily, and you display very few skin concerns.
Your whole face appears shiny or greasy. Your pores may be visible or appear enlarged.
Your face feels tight and it appears to be dull. You may also experience cracking or flaking skin.
Your face appears shiny or greasy in specific areas (commonly the T-Zone of forehead, nose, and chin), and your skin feels dry or flaky in other areas (commonly your cheeks or jawline).
This may not be something that is visible with this test, but something you can determine as you use products. If your skin becomes red or feels irritated by mild products, you likely have this skin type.

3. BRIGHTENS: Face cream that hydrates and protects, the ideal combo for a radiant, dewy glow

AHA (Alpha Hydroxy Acid) works to brighten your complexion by loosening dead skin cells. These acids are usually more effective exfoliators than scrubs or cloths. AHA can even help diminish the appearance of fine lines.
A naturally-occurring antioxidant that is known to fight free radicals on skin’s surface. It protects your face from visible damage that you see as fine lines and uneven skin tone, and it creates a glow as it fortifies the skin’s moisture barrier.
This peptide acts in the same way that naturally occurring peptides work in younger skin. So as your skin ages, applying this topical peptide supports your skin’s natural renewal processes, so skin appearance is noticeably improved.

1. To decrease this risk, regularly use a sunscreen with a Broad Spectrum SPF value of 15 or higher and other sun protection measures including: Limit time in sun, especially from 10 AM - 2 PM. Wear long-sleeved shirts, pants, hats, and sunglasses.
2. Apply liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure. Reapply at least every 2 hours. Use water resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating. Sun Protection Measures: Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer and early skin aging.

This
ain’t your grandma’s skincare.
There are people who say skincare isn’t
a science. We’re not those people. Our beauty scientists have spent over 50
years improving our formulas and discovering, distilling, and enhancing new
ingredients to bring you the cutting edge in skincare. Here, we’ll talk about one
of our favorite ingredients: collagen peptides, and break down the major
benefits of adding our fantastic formulas to your skincare routine.
We’ve got the two little words your
skin longs to hear: plumping moisture. If you know your skincare, you’ve heard
of collagen, and you may have heard of peptides. (Psst – if you haven’t, we
wrote about themhere.) Our proprietary
formulas, with collagen peptide, help deliver visible skin transformation.
Our Collagen Peptide formulas have the absolute
highest level of peptide in any Olay formula. Our formulas, with Collagen
Peptide and Vitamin B3+, help make skin look firmer and maintain moisture.
That’s the recipe for visibly smoother, firmer skin.
While anyone can benefit from Collagen Peptide,
these formulas really pack a punch on skin that’s just starting to see wrinkles,
like when you’re in your late twenties and early thirties. They are also great
for women in their forties, fifties, sixties and beyond who want to see
smoother, plumper skin.
You’ll notice the most difference using these
formulas if you have skin that’s a bit drier. We don’t want to brag too much on
our formulas (we like to let the results speak for themselves), but our
Collagen Peptide 24 Hydrating Moisturizer hydrates better than $100, $200, and even a $400 cream to visibly firm skin. That
said, normal and oily skin types can most certainly use
this formula and see a difference as well!
We love Collagen Peptide, and we think that once
you start using them, you will too. If you’re interested in adding them to your
skincare routine, head over to ourCollagen Peptide 24page  to get started!

About Hyaluronic Acid
What is Hyaluronic Acid?
This moisture magnet ingredient is known to regulate water within skin’s surface. It absorbs water like a sponge and holds many times its own weight to help replenish and retain moisture to keep skin hydrated throughout the day.
How Do Olay’s Hyaluronic Acid Formulas Work?
Lightweight gel, serum, and eye formulas target skin’s surface while diving into the skin’s barrier, up to 10 layers deep, to plump the skin with hydration. Use cleanser to prepare skin and SPF 30 to help protect from UV rays.
What Benefits Will I See?
Proven to provide 24 hours of hydration* for dewy, hydrated skin around the clock. In an Olay consumer study over 2 weeks 92% of women also reported gel moisturizer provided long lasting hydration and 95% said skin felt smooth and supple.

Why Olay Hyaluronic + Peptides?

About Vitamin C
What is Vitamin C?
