Must have for dry summer weather! It is so hydrating!
Was this review helpful?
Purchase date: 06/12/2025
This creme has the most amazing scent! Very fresh and clean! It's a bit oilier than I anticipated but overall very good!
Purchase date: 04/06/2025
Product evaporates overtime so even if you use it sparingly it doesn't last because the little balls shrivel down and the product is essentially evaporating overtime. Other than that good product saw immediate results.
Purchase date: 06/05/2025
Great product smooth makes my skin like silk
Purchase date: 03/31/2025
I enjoy this product. Always hydrates, and keeps working through the day.
Purchase date: 05/23/2025
This product gets a standing ovation from me! I literally only need a minuscule amount to moisturize my whole face. And my skin is so vibrant and supple all day long! I will never use another moisturizer again.
Purchase date: 04/20/2025
I used it in the past. Order it again. It hydrates my skin. I use it for a day time as a part of my routine. Good value for the money.
Purchase date: 04/12/2025
Excellent product for older skin. Goes on smoothly, absorbs nicely, has no oily residue. With or without makeup, it really makes a difference to my skin. Worth the price.
Purchase date: 03/23/2025
I own everything Chanel makes in the Hydra Beauty collection.....everything single item. The Hydra Beauty Micro Cream is positively remarkable, indispensable, and miraculous, and incredible. I am 82 and my face looks as if I were 68.
Purchase date: 02/23/2025
Product name and packaging is confusingly similar to Chanel hydra beauty cr√®me. Along with difficulties getting to the creme on the website, it's too easy to purchase the wrong product - as I did -at a much higher price with unsatisfactory results.
Purchase date: 01/17/2025
Love everything about it! Lightweight, moisturizing and pleasantly scented. My go to everytime!!!
Purchase date: 09/28/2024
This product did absolutely nothing good for my skin. As much as I enjoy using Chanel products, I'm not sure what happened here. My skin actually looked blotchy and seemed drier than usual.
Purchase date: 11/22/2024
I love this product
Purchase date: 11/14/2024
Hydra micro is the best moisturizer I have ever used ! Goes right in and is never greasy. Keeps my face moisturized and glowing ! I use the serum and the eye as well ! Very pleased !
Purchase date: 10/08/2024
I love this hydros creme, it has a wonderful fragrance, and you only need a little bit.

Really nice red. Smooth putting on, just wait a little before applying shine gloss. Not all day staying on but does last a few hours which is good enough for me.

The LE LIFT PRO protocol: a skincare line that helps restore the look of the youth triangle, the area from the high points of the cheeks to the tip of the chin, which inverts with age. Each formula features melipona enzymatic ingredient.
Cultivated at the CHANEL open-sky laboratory in Costa Rica, melipona enzymatic ingredient is a precious honey sourced from a supply network developed in partnership with Alianza Campesina Flora Nueva, which protects melipona bees and local biodiversity while also contributing to the producers’ economic development. This highly concentrated ingredient helps reinforce skin’s support and correct the look of advanced signs of aging. A combination of niacinamide and Centella Asiatica helps reduce the appearance of dark spots and soothe skin, while hyaluronic acid offers long-lasting hydration.
Inspired by techniques used for decades in aesthetic dermatology to promote resiliency, CHANEL has created massage gestures to complement the LE LIFT PRO protocol. Before applying the product, perform the signature LE GESTE LIFT PRO technique: Begin with deep pinching movements across the cheeks and jawline. Repeat 3 times. Then, use your thumb and index finger to lightly pinch expression lines perpendicularly. After applying LE LIFT PRO CONCENTRÉ CONTOURS, smooth a thin layer of MASQUE UNIFORMITÉ over the entire face, avoiding the eye area. Leave on overnight. For an instant glow boost, apply the mask generously and leave on for 10 minutes, then wipe off excess with a damp cotton pad. Follow with CRÈME VOLUME. *Clinical evaluation of 33 women after using LE LIFT PRO MASQUE UNIFORMITÉ for 1 night **Not suitable for use pre- or post-procedure. Consult your doctor before using. ***Clinical evaluation of 30 women after 2 months of using LE LIFT PRO CONCENTRÉ CONTOURS and CRÈME VOLUME in the morning and CONCENTRÉ CONTOURS and MASQUE UNIFORMITÉ at night

I love Chanel products but unfortunately, I did not care for the mask. It's messy anyway I had an adverse effect which is a shame.

Sticky and did not go on smooth. I returned the item

This masque is amazing! I'm a senior citizen so I'm always looking for something to help my aging skin. I could see a visible difference in my face after using it.

HOW DO YOU CREATE YOUR PERSONALIZED ROUTINE?
Choose between the following options: - A targeted routine to address specific concerns - A comprehensive routine for exceptional regenerating benefits
Pick 2 benefits to focus on: - Hydration - Radiance - Even skin tone, with fewer dark spots - Refined skin texture - Smoother skin, with diminished fine lines and wrinkles - Plumpness - Firmness - Redefined features, with less sagging
A simple routine with just the essentials or a comprehensive skincare ritual—choose from among the 10 steps recommended by CHANEL: - 3 preliminary gestures: remove makeup, cleanse, prepare with a toner - 3 essential gestures central to every routine: care for the eye contour, target with a serum, moisturize with a cream - 4 complementary gestures to finish the ritual: care for lips, protect against the sun and pollution, revive with a mist, reinforce with a mask
Depending on your concerns and the steps you selected, pick the sensations and textures you prefer.​
Receive your customized routine, featuring formulas perfectly suited to your skin’s needs.
THE SKINCARE STEPS
Thoroughly removing makeup daily keeps skin clean and healthy. This step should be simple and effective, even with longwearing and waterproof formulas.
It is important to cleanse and exfoliate to eliminate pollution particles and excess sebum. This step helps rebalance the complexion, bring back its glow and prep for the rest of your routine. Exfoliating also helps refine the look of skin texture.
Toners, lotions and essences are the prelude to the next steps in your ritual. Skin is better prepared to receive the full benefits of the ingredients in the formulas that follow.
Eyes require special attention: Skin is thinner and drier in this area than on the rest of the body. These expert products are both incredibly powerful and gentle.
Highly concentrated with potent ingredients, serums deliver dramatic results. What makes them unique: ultra-sophisticated formulas with exquisite textures that melt into skin.
In the morning and evening, hydrate with a cream that comforts, softens and protects while also addressing your specific concerns and complementing your chosen serum.
Lips and the area around the mouth are fragile and particularly vulnerable to signs of aging. Keep them looking plump and supple with a nourishing formula.
This vital step helps defend against UV rays and pollution to preserve skin’s youthful appearance.
Face mists are a final perfecting step to improve the quality of your skin and prep for makeup.
A gesture for exceptional, instant results. An unexpected sensorial experience. Use regularly or occasionally to enhance your ritual.

Ref. 141780
All the anti-aging expertise of CHANEL is showcased in a potent face cream featuring a high concentration of naturally derived ingredients. After 7 days, skin looks 19%* smoother, 15%* plumper and 25%* more radiant. After 4 weeks, the appearance of wrinkles is diminished by 13%** and sagging looks reduced by 17%**. The complexion appears 14%** more lifted and 20%** firmer. The moisturizer is available in 3 ultra-sensorial textures to ideally suit all skin types: LE LIFT CR√àME FINE, LE LIFT CR√àME and LE LIFT CR√àME RICHE.
At the heart of this powerful formula is botanical alfalfa concentrate, which is as efficient as retinol*** and gentle on skin. Extracted from an ancient plant grown organically in France, it is known for its unique nutritional and mineral-replenishing properties. Botanical alfalfa concentrate works on multiple levels: It helps support collagen, improve renewal, maintain skin‚Äôs balance and strengthen barrier function.
To complement the benefits of the LE LIFT skincare line, CHANEL experts have developed LE GESTE LIFT: signature movements inspired by Kobido, a traditional Japanese massage technique. After applying the product, use the palm of the hand to deeply smooth upward on one side of the face, working from the base of the neck to the forehead in the following sequence: 1. Upward from the collarbone to the jaw. 2. Outward along the jawline, from the chin to the ear. 3. Upward along the cheek, from the lower jaw to the cheekbone. 4. From the nose to the temple, following the natural line of the cheekbone. 5. Outward on the temple. 6. Upward on the forehead, from the eyebrow to the hairline. Repeat the same movements on the other side of the face. *Clinical evaluation of 31 women after 7 days of using LE LIFT CR√àME **Clinical evaluation of 34 women after 4 weeks of using LE LIFT CR√àME ***Comparison of some factors involved in epidermal renewal by ingredients based on in vitro tests.

Purchase date: 09/07/2024
The cream is fantastic, just like all the other products offered by Chanel. It provides a refreshing, cooling sensation while effectively moisturizing my skin. The scent is wonderful, as is to be expected from Chanel. However, my only concern is that I wish there was more product as the container it came in is Very thick glass.

An exceptional cream that combines every effective element of the Vanilla Planifolia plant with Swertia extract to help rejuvenate the look of skin and address the appearance of all youth parameters*. Composed of 92%** naturally derived ingredients, the double-emulsion formula offers a moment of incredible sensoriality. Exquisite to the touch, it feels fresh and lightweight upon application, then melts into skin and absorbs quickly. Immediately, the complexion looks radiant and toned. SUBLIMAGE L’EXTRAIT DE CRÈME is now presented in a refillable format. Created in collaboration with a premier French glassmaker, the revolutionary patented*** jar houses a travel-friendly refill that can be removed for on-the-go use.
Vanilla Planifolia was selected from more than 117 vanilla varieties for its extraordinary richness in polyketones. Grown and harvested at the CHANEL open-sky laboratory in Madagascar, it has been refined to make 4 key ingredients: polyfractioned Vanilla Planifolia, Éphémères of Planifolia, enfleurage oil and Intense Vanilla Planifolia Water. Himalayan Swertia is sourced from a biodiverse region in Bhutan, where it has been used for centuries to care for skin. Through a long-term partnership with CHANEL Research, it is harvested by hand every 3 years during the plant’s flowering cycle. It is then transformed to make a custom restoring complex specific to CHANEL. A blend of precious oils provides a feeling of comfort.
The signature technique, LE GESTE SUBLIME RÉPARATION, is designed to complement the restoring effects of SUBLIMAGE L’EXTRAIT DE CRÈME and enhance the sensorial experience. STEP 1: THE CHANEL APPLICATION Apply a small amount of SUBLIMAGE L’EXTRAIT DE CRÈME to each cheek, as well as the forehead and neck. With both hands, smooth over the entire face from the center outward. For the neck, follow the jawline. STEP 2: RESTORATIVE MOVEMENTS Hold hands flat against skin and use deep, enveloping strokes. Start at the T-zone and work up toward the hairline, then move to the cheeks, lip area, jawline and, finally, the trapezius. Repeat the movement 3 times on each area. STEP 3: LE GESTE SUBLIME RADIANCE Massage from the center of the face outward using deep circular movements. Begin under the chin, massaging along the jaw and up toward the ears. Next, massage from the jaw up to the cheeks and toward the temples. Finish on the forehead, moving from the center of the face to the temples. Repeat these movements 3 times. Elasticity and tone are restored for a smooth, radiant appearance. To complete the ritual, pair SUBLIMAGE L’EXTRAIT DE CRÈME with SUBLIMAGE L’EXTRAIT DE NUIT. *Evaluation of comprehensive skincare benefits as defined by CHANEL Research: hydration, comfort, wrinkles, structure, uniformity, strength and radiance **According to the ISO 16128 standard ***International patent pending

I love L'Extrait de Creme and what it does to my skin. It is very rich, so I alternate it with Le Baume. My facial skin looks very good at 76 years!

Excelent my skin is bright. Tight , like a baby
Purchase date: 06/27/2024
Beautiful buttery texture that magically melts into skin. Luxurious and light lovely Chanel scent while comforting and smoothing skin's surface. Provides a plumping effect and and glow to face. I am 40 yrs of age and have dryer skin that gets irritated easily as I use a prescription Retin-A, so it's hard for me to find a moisturizer that is not too heavy yet deeply moisturizing. Also I find I cannot mix too many other brand products or serums (like vitamin C's, harsh exfoliating AHA's, etc.) but this unique Chanel cream is a resolution to all my concerns! It's my favorite by far, as it softens and brightens my complexion while healing redness. I use it alone or with other gentler Chanel serums. Love the gold refill as well, so convenient to travel with!!
Purchase date: 11/19/2023
Best face cream I've ever used. At night I use the L'Extrait De Creme with the L'Extrait De Nuit. They work extremely well together. I wake up with a glowing and smooth complexion and surprisingly my pores are even smaller. I love the way the L'Extrait line makes my face feel and look. Yes, both the De Creme and the De Nuit are very expensive but they're worth it! You have one life and one face. Why not treat both the very best you can - your face will thank you.
I love the gracious moisturizing that sublimate gives to my skin. Wrinkles seem to disappear. I see a gentle glow across my face and neck. I feel so elegant.. thank you
Purchase date: 05/13/2021
This actually works! I have been using skin care 52 of my 73 years. This is by far the best skin care I found. Plus having one product instead of many. Wow

The formula helps reduce the harmful effects of environmental aggressors by 82%***. Suitable for all skin types, including sensitive. The N°1 DE CHANEL line seeks to minimize its environmental impact with sustainably developed formulas. The serum-in-mist contains up to 98%**** naturally derived ingredients. Each product is housed in environmentally sound packaging, without cellophane or paper leaflets, for a reduced carbon footprint. Containers are crafted with lighter-weight glass***** and printed with organic ink******.
The N°1 DE CHANEL line preserves a youthful appearance by drawing on the extraordinary longevity of a single flower: the Red Camellia. A plant that can live for up to an incredible 200 years*******, defying time. After studying the camellia for 19 years, CHANEL Research has harnessed its energy to make Red Camellia Extract, which is obtained through a 3-step extraction process: The petals first undergo cold fragmentation, then their antioxidant properties are released through hydrofusion. Finally, the solution is purified, resulting in an extract highly concentrated in protocatechuic acid, which boosts skin’s vitality and helps protect against oxidative stress. The formula also features camellia leaf buds, which have a high concentration of a soothing amino acid, as well as antioxidant-rich polyphenols. Red Camellia Oil and Red Camellia Water provide intense hydration and a feeling of freshness.
Shake the bottle to combine the bi-phase formula. Close your eyes******* and apply to the face, spraying twice in a horizontal motion and twice in a vertical motion. Press the product into skin with the palms of the hands to help it absorb. Reapply as needed during the day. *Clinical evaluation of 33 women after 12 hours and 5 applications **Self-assessment by 33 women, comparing improvement after the first application and after using 5 times per day for 7 days ***Ex vivo test: reduction in the expression of a marker of oxidation when subjected to pollution ****According to the ISO 16128 standard *****Compared to the average weight of CHANEL bottles and jars of similar capacity.

True to Gabrielle Chanel’s spirit and aligned with her avant-garde vision, the name of this line is a number. N°1 DE CHANEL is also the first collection from the House to unite skincare, makeup and a fragrance mist, embodying a new generation of beauty that returns to the essentials. The House’s iconic flower, the camellia, is the N°1 ingredient and has been proven to be exceptionally effective at targeting the first signs of aging.
The Camellia japonica plant, which blooms in winter and features evergreen leaves, is a remarkable botanical treasure. Also known as the Red Czar Camellia, it is extraordinarily rich in protocatechuic acid, a powerful molecule CHANEL Research discovered to be unique to this particular camellia flower. The ingredient possesses exceptional revitalizing properties and helps support skin’s vitality.
First, purify and refresh skin with the powder-to-foam cleanser and prep for the rest of your routine with the lotion. Target signs of aging with the eye cream, serum and serum-in-mist, and lock in hydration with the refillable face cream. Next, create a clean canvas with the buildable foundation before adding a touch of colour with the lip and cheek balm. Complete your ritual with a spritz of L’EAU ROUGE fragrance mist.

I love it. Very light on the face, but feels lovely.
I hate to be the downer but it's sticky and not like a fine mist. Was really disappointed that the bottom of the bottle isn't flat so you can't stand it up it has to lay on its side. I feel it's over priced. I won't be ordering again :(
