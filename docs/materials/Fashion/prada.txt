Prada Re-Nylon 2025
Showcasing the philosophy and actuality of Prada Re-Nylon, these episodes cross the Atlantic Ocean to explore the seas of Europe and Central America, charting environmental actions already underway to help safeguard marine life for generations to come.
Reflecting global concerns and the shifting sensibilities of new generations, this docu-series explores fashion’s ability to make a difference and create true and lasting positive change on the environment around it.
For Her
For Him
For the second film, Benedict Cumberbatch travels to the Norwegian town of Bodø, to see the impact of humanity on the sonic underwater environment. Captured on film within the ocean of the Arctic Circle, whales and other oceanic mammals use a variety of sounds for communication and sensation. The song of whales in particular can cover vast distances — their haunting sounds have been studied to even flow across entire ocean basins. Environmental advocate, actress, SEA BEYONDer and Goodwill Ambassador of the project Valentina Gottlieb speaks with Dr. Heike Vester, a biologist who specializes in social behavior and bio-acoustics of marine animals, to examine the impact of human activity on the rich acoustic environment of the ocean — the noise pollution of shipping, and seismic surveys in the search for natural oil and gas. It also details measures we can take to combat this disruption, and help maintain the delicate balance of marine life, sustaining species and their languages for future generations.
CREDITS: Talent: Benedict Cumberbatch Sea Beyonder: Valentina Gottlieb Director: Johnny Langenheim DoP: Keidrych Wasley Creative Director: Richard Phillips Local Expert: Heike Vester
For the third episode, Actress Sadie Sink travels to La Paz, Mexico and the Pacific Ocean to discover the whale shark. Gentle giants, whale sharks are the world’s largest fish - their roles as “gardeners of the ocean” is derived from their diet of plankton and algae, consuming enormous quantities to fuel their vast size. In turn, they aid marine biology by controlling these plant levels – excessive amounts of either would decrease sunlight and oxygen in the surrounding ocean, disrupting the natural ecosystem. But today these essential animals are under threat, as marine biologist, SEA BEYONDer and Goodwill Ambassador of the project Giovanni Chimienti and whale shark specialist Alberto Garcia Baciero discuss. Their numbers are affected by overfishing – where whale sharks are often accidentally caught – struck by vessels when feeding near the surface, and injured through unsustainable tourism. A major problem is ocean pollution, which both affects the animals themselves and the plankton that is their main source of sustenance.

In the final installation of this four-part film series, created in collaboration with Prada and storytelling partner National Geographic CreativeWorks, actress Sadie Sink introduces us to the Great Kelp Highway of Northern and Central America. A vital marine ecosystem, the Great Kelp Highway denotes a stretch of subterranean forests of kelp that runs for thousands of miles along the pacific coasts of the Americas. The richness and biodiversity of the wildlife of the Great Kelp Highway – edible fish, shellfish, marine mammals, birds and seaweed – sustained not only life within its waters, but through centuries of fishing, humankind as well. Sadie Sink, alongside marine biologist, SEA BEYONDer and Goodwill Ambassador of the project Giovanni Chimienti and scientist Rodrigo Beas, explore the Great Kelp Highway in the waters of Islas Coronado, off the northwest coast of the Mexican state of Baja California. First-hand, they witness how rising ocean temperatures, near-extinction of species, overfishing and global pollution have all affected the kelp forests – a delicate habitat, now endangered.

Prada Fall/Winter 2025 Womenswear Show
RAW GLAMOUR
What does femininity mean today? How can it be defined?
The Fall/Winter 2025 Prada show by Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons is an interrogation of these concepts – itself an exercise in posing questions, provoking discussion, around our collective perception of the typicality of femininity, about notions of beauty, about how those perceptions can constantly change.

Prada Caffè Harrods, London
March 31, 2023 - June 2026
Monday to Saturday: 9am - 9pm
Sunday: 12pm - 6pm
Prada announces the opening of Prada Caffè at Harrods in London, a space designed to add a new dimension to the brand and offer customers a unique and engaging experience.
The environment revisits Prada’s visual hallmarks, with every choice, from the decor and menu to the tableware and atmosphere, reflecting the brand’s language, approach and distinctive way of viewing the world.
BOOK NOW
The range of food and drink on offer covers the entire day, from breakfast to evening cocktails, and provides a subtle, modern take on Italian tradition, with savoury pastries filled with high-quality ingredients or gnocchi with basil pesto sitting alongside burrata and parmigiana, and spritz, and negroni-based aperitifs complementing the list of signature cocktails. The wine list spans the whole of Italy, with bottles from Sicily to Piedmont. Pastries play a central role, displayed both on the spectacular central counter and the wall behind: the selection of fine patisserie products pairs expert craftsmanship with modern techniques and classic ingredients with more contemporary flavors and aromas.
