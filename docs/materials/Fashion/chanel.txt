product information
A silky scented body oil that offers intense moisture, for supple skin, and prolongs the trail of the CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE fragrance. The formula is composed of 88%* naturally derived ingredients and absorbs quickly, draping skin in a veil of light and delivering a soft-as-satin feel. Presented in the iconic glass CHANCE bottle with a spray format that allows for easy and generous application. “Luck is my soul.” All her life, Gabrielle Chanel cultivated chance. Believing that anything was possible, she transformed her dreams into reality. For CHANEL, luck is a state of mind, a way of being. A declaration of faith that drives you to take control of your destiny. A way to bet everything on yourself, to choose yourself and to always give yourself another chance to play the game.
Infused with the notes of the original composition, CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Body Oil showcases all of the expression’s energetic and lively qualities. A floral-sparkling interpretation where the zesty freshness of citron notes, the softness of jasmine and the vibrant presence of a teak wood note intertwine.
Mist all over or spray onto hands, then massage into skin. *According to the ISO 16128 standard

Fragrance n°19
A daring, distinctive fragrance, N°19 is the other great number of the House. With a contrasting accord composed of green and powdery notes, the scent pays tribute to the day Mademoiselle was born: August 19, 1883. In N°19 POUDRÉ, another expression of the signature accord, the trail of the original composition encounters the softness of white musk.

collection première
In 1987, CHANEL created its first watch for women: the PREMIÈRE, inspired by the codes of the House. The octagonal case evokes the stopper of the N°5 fragrance bottle. The original bracelet, interlaced with leather—like the chain of the iconic quilted bag—like the chain of the iconic quilted handbag—has been reinterpreted in gourmette chain, ceramic or velvet-finish versions. A timeless, feminine timepiece to slip on your wrist day and night.

WATCHES AND FINE JEWELRY
5th AVENUE BOUTIQUE NEW YORK CITY
In 1921, Gabrielle Chanel launched a boundary-breaking fragrance she called N°5. 5, like her favorite number. 5, like the date she showed her couture collections. 5, like the 5th symbol of the zodiac, Mademoiselle’s astrological sign: Leo. Over 100 years later, CHANEL writes a new chapter in the legendary story of 5 by choosing 5th Avenue for the House’s first dedicated Watches and Fine Jewelry boutique in the United States. A lucky number, an eternal code, a symbolic new address.

The dazzling intricacy of the ETERNAL N°5 necklace, TWEED ICÔNE RUBAN ring and SIGNATURE DUO earrings echoes the exquisite details of the singer-songwriter’s custom black chiffon gown adorned with crystals and feathers.
Crafted in 18K yellow gold, the twisted bracelet of the PREMIÈRE GALON timepiece is reminiscent of the braids on the actor’s classic tweed jacket. The LUNE TALISMAN BUTTONS earrings add a boldly assertive finishing touch.
The singer’s black-and-white ensemble dramatically showcases the House’s most iconic symbols, including a silk camellia, strands of pearls and a RUBAN ring in 18K white gold* set with diamonds, inspired by the fluidity of the ribbon.
