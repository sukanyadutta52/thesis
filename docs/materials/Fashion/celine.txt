Wolfgang Tillmans
CELINE introduces “Accès Libre” in celebration of Wolfgang Tillmans "Rien ne nous y préparait – Tout nous y préparait” exhibition, at the Centre Pompidou.
This unique initiative was imagined as an open invitation to all, offering free admission to the public on four select dates : June 13th July 3rd August 28th September 22nd.
From 13 June to 22 September 2025, the Centre Pompidou is giving free rein to German artist Wolfgang Tillmans, who has come up with an original project to round off the programme at the Paris building. He has moved into Level 2 of the Public Information Library (Bpi), transforming the 6,000 m2 of space in a curatorial experiment that establishes a dialogue between his work and the library space, questioning it both from an architectural standpoint and as a place for the transmission of knowledge.
Throughout his artistic career, Tillmans (born in Remscheid, Ger­many in 1968) has pushed back the boundaries of the visible di­mension, immortalising and revealing the fragile beauty of the physical world. Proposing new ways of creating images, he ex­plores the profound transformation of the information media and channels of our time. In the process, he created a unique aesthe­tic universe, born of the countercultural spirit of the early 1990s. Tillmans’ multifaceted work has led him on a quest to define a new humanism and alternative ways of living together, with a las­ting impact on contemporary creation. His work is deeply rooted in the “Here and Now”: he provides a sweeping overview of forms of knowledge and presents a free and sincere experience of the world, examining the contemporary condition of Europe while ex­ploring the techniques of mechanical reproduction.

OSAKA EXPOSITION 2025
WELCOME TO CELINE MAKI-E
CELINE's special exhibition "CELINE MAKI-E" was held at the France Pavilion of the Osaka-Kansai Expo 2025 from April 13th to May 11th, 2025.
As a second phase of the Expo, which attracted around 850.000 visitors in one month, CELINE keeps the momentum alive through a special installation, presented in some of its Japanese boutiques: CELINE MIDOSUJI, OMOTESANDO, GINZA, AZABUDAI.
IN-STORE EVENT CELINE OMOTESANDO
Place : CELINE OMOTESANDO
Date : AUGUST 1ST – AUGUST 31ST
This travelling extension of the exhibition will showcase the fine Urushi Triomphe art pieces from lacquerware artists Hikoju Makie together with the three precious Triomphe handbags, developed specially by CELINE for the World Expo.
As a mirroring experience, two « Hands at Work » videos, by contemporary artist Soshi Nakamura, will allow visitors to contemplate the delicate savoir-faire behind both Hikoju Makie’s artists in the process of creating the Urushi pieces, together with CELINE’s leatherworkers crafting the Triomphe handbags.
SPECIAL CHARITY PROJECT
Due to multiple factors, the art of lacquerware tends to be threatened and therefore needs all kinds of support. As a house deeply attached to craftsmanship and the preservation of traditions, CELINE is proud to support the Non-Profit Organization Ichikiro-No-Kai through a special donation program.
On one hand, a part of the benefits from the Triomphe precious handbags sold during the in-store exhibition events will be kept aside for supporting the NPO; while six exclusive charms have been designed and developed, entirely made to fund the organization. The charms are shaped as a plum flower, used widely in Japanese symbolism for its auspicious wish of continuity & longevity. It also recalls the motif engraved on the Triomphe Urushi art pieces and the one stamped inside the Triomphe handbags.
For both Triomphe handbags and charms, special packaging has been created, to highlight their uniqueness.
*Please inquire about the release date and stores for the charity items.

PROFILE
NPO ICHIKIRO-NO-KAI
THE CURRENT SITUATION OF JAPANESE LACQUER IS VERY SEVERE AS A RESULT OF THE AGING OF THE LACQUER SCRAPERS, THE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING SUCCESSORS, AND THE DRASTIC DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LACQUER TREES DUE TO THE EXHAUSTION AND DEVASTATION OF AGRICULTURE IN THE MOUNTAINOUS AREAS OF JAPAN. THUS, THE AMOUNT OF DOMESTICALLY PRODUCED LACQUER HAS BEEN DECREASING YEAR BY YEAR, TO REACH ONLY 1 TO 2% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT USED IN THE COUNTRY.
IN ADDITION TO THE CREATION OF NEW PIECES, JAPANESE LACQUER IS ALSO REQUIRED FOR THE REPAIR OF NATIONAL TREASURES AND IMPORTANT CULTURAL PROPERTIES. SINCE THE SUPPLY OF LACQUER IS UNSTABLE, THERE IS A NEED TO NOT ONLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM AT HAND, BUT ALSO CONFRONT THE ISSUE OVER A LONG SPAN OF TIME. IN A FEW WORDS, BOTH THE QUANTITY AND THE QUALITY OF LACQUER MUST BE IMPROVED.
IN 1997, 17 LACQUER ARTISTS WHO FELT A SENSE OF CRISIS ABOUT THE CONTINUED DECLINE IN LACQUER TAPPERS, FOUNDED THE ICHIKIRO ASSOCIATION.
SINCE THEN, ICHIKIRO-NO-KAI HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN ACTIVITIES SUCH AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A LACQUER TREE PATRONAGE SYSTEM, A LACQUER TREE PLANTING PROJECT AND THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE PRODUCTION PROCESS OF LACQUER SCRAPING TOOLS, WHICH ARE IN DANGER OF DISAPPEARING.
ICHIKIRO-NO-KAI HAS BEEN AN NPO SINCE 2013 AND IS PLANNING TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF ITS ACTIVITIES. WITH THIS PARTNERSHIP, CELINE HOPES TO SUPPORT THE GROWING OF MORE LACQUER TREES THROUGHOUT JAPAN AND THE TRANSMISSION OF CENTURIES-OLD TRADITIONAL TECHNIQUES RELATED TO LACQUER ART AND LACQUER SCRAPING.

TRIOMPHE URUSHI
BY HIKOJU MAKIE
Under a special partnership with CELINE, Hikoju Makie created three Urushi lacquer "Triomphe" art pieces for the Osaka-Kansai World Expo 2025.
Japanese crafstmanship meets the Triomphe, symbol of the parisian house, as a tribute to the respect for heritage and transmission shared by artists and artisans everywhere in the world. Linked together, urushi lacquerware art pieces from Hikoju Makie, and exclusive CELINE handbags, connect elements from a rich history of techniques and know-how to our contemporary times.
GOLD TRIOMPHE URUSHI - Natural laquered urushi in katsura wood, natural lacquer, taka maki-e lacquer & gold leaf finishing with bamboo, pine & plum motifs. BLACK TRIOMPHE URUSHI - Natural laquered urushi in katsura wood, natural lacquer & hira maki-e finishing decorated with bamboo, pine & plum motifs. VERMILLON TRIOMPHE URUSHI - Natural laquered urushi in katsura wood, natural lacquer & hira maki-e finishing decorated with bamboo, pine & plum motifs.
Together, they express the most traditional values of the japanese culture: vermillon red for resurrection and rebirth, black for elegance and formality, and gold for sunshine and nature.

LAQUER ARTIST GROUP HIKOJU MAKIE
Hikoju Makie is a group of Japanese artists, specialized in the production of traditional lacquered pieces and artworks, based in Wajima (Ishikawa prefecture).
Lacquerware has existed for thousands of years, used as a tool to interconnect elements from japanese traditions and culture. Hikoju Makie incorporates contemporary sense and humor into their work, conveying important thoughts left by ancestors for posterity.
The group, founded in 2004, discovered the singularity and ethnicity of Japan’s identity through folk philosophy, classical literature, and the wisdom and reflexion from daily life rituals. the mastery of lacquer, in the hands of the craftsmen, receives the role of messenger, to unite it to other art forms and new dimensions. As a bridge between past, present and future, Hikoju Makie is taking various measures to ensure lacquer art will be handed down to later generations, wether by working with different materials and mediums, collaborating with different industries or engaging in sustainable projects.
Various pieces from the collective are permanently featured in the museum of lacquer arts (Münster, Germany) as well as in the Victoria & Albert museum (London, UK), while temporary exhibitions included, amongst others: the Pola Museum of Art (Hakone, Japan), Tainan City cultural festival (Taiwan), Bahrain National Museum, Gallery 27 (London), Museum of Urushi Art (Wajima, Japan), museum & art gallery of the university of hong kong, suntory museum of art (Tokyo).
Master Takashi Wakamiya received several awards such as the Japan Ishikawa International Urushi grand prize (2014), the Japan Design Prize (2015) and was appointed japan cultural envoy by the agency for cultural affairs (2014).
INTERVIEW WITH TAKASHI WAKAMIYA
A special interview with Takashi Wakamiya, the producer and founder of Hikoju Makie for 20 years. He speaks about what he wanted to convey through his collaboration with Celine and what is necessary to pass on traditional crafts and techniques to the future.
THE TRIOMPHE BAG BY CELINE ATELIERS
Developed exclusively for the Osaka Expo, the three Triomphe bags showcased are colored in black, red & gold, recalling the urushi art pieces built specially by Hikoju Makie.
Made of precious leathers, they are lined on the inside with lambskin and decorated with a gold-stamped plum motif, used widely in Japanese symbolism for its auspicious wish of continuity and longevity. As a testimony of their excusivity, each bag receives an unique number, and also gold-stamped on the interior lining.

VISUAL ARTIST SOSHI NAKAMURA
Born in Kumamoto prefecture in 1991, his interdisciplinary practice includes flat works, sculpture, sound, and performance, with a focus on video installations. He explores what makes us human by interweaving hidden narratives and relationships between changing phenomena, transient moments, and ethereal subjects.
In his recent work, he has been interested in contemporary spirituality residing in intangible subjects such as Japan’s classic noh plays, “lost” films, group performances, and artificial intelligence.
He is also part of “MANTLE”, a visual art collective with artist Shu Isaka, examining natural phenomena and the global environment over time and their relationship to human activities and the present.
Major exhibitions and performances include, amongst others: "Echoes" (Contemporary Art Museum Kumamoto, Kumamoto, 2025), "Dance in the Haze" (The 5th Floor, Tokyo, 2023), "Pineal Gland Sashimi" (United Art Museum, Wuhan, 2024), "End of Summer" (Yale Union, Portland, 2019), as a mantle "DXP-Towards the Next Interface-" (21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, 2023).

ROCHELLE GOLDBERG PARIS PARFUM ST HONORÉ – COMMISSIONED BORN IN VANCOUVER, CANADA, IN 1984, ROCHELLE GOLDBERG EARNED HER MFA FROM BARD COLLEGE, AND CURRENTLY LIVES AND WORKS IN NEW YORK CITY. IN 2018, SHE WAS THE WINNER OF THE BATTAGLIA FOUNDRY SCULPTURE PRIZE #03 AND ARTISTIN-RESIDENCE AT THE CHINATI FOUNDATION, MARFA. ADDITIONALLY, GOLDBERG WAS THE ARTIST-IN-RESIDENCE AT THE ATELIER CALDER IN THE SPRING OF 2017, AND THE RECIPIENT OF THE 2015 LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AWARD. IN 2016, GOLDBERG HAD HER FIRST INSTITUTIONAL SOLO EXHIBITION AT SCULPTURECENTER IN NEW YORK. SHE ALSO CONTRIBUTED A LARGE-SCALE INSTALLATION WORK TO MIRROR CELLS, CURATED BY CHRISTOPHER LEW AND JANE PANETTA AT THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART, AND PARTICIPATED IN THE OKAYAMA ART SUMMIT, A BIENNIAL EXHIBITION ORGANIZED BY LIAM GILLICK ACROSS MULTIPLE VENUES IN OKAYAMA, JAPAN. NO WHERE, NOW HERE, GOLDBERG’S SOLO EXHIBITION AT GAMEC IN BERGAMO, ITALY WAS ON VIEW THROUGH JANUARY 2017. THE CATALOGUE FOR THAT EXHIBITION, PUBLISHED BY MOUSSE AND GAMEC, AS WELL AS A NEW MONOGRAPH, CANNIBAL ACTIF (NEW YORK: TOTEM/SEQUENCE PRESS), WERE BOTH RELEASED IN 2017. INTRALOCUTORS, HER FIRST SOLO EXHIBITION AT MIGUEL ABREU GALLERY, WAS ON VIEW IN THE SPRING OF 2017.
THE MASKS IN THE COMPOSITE RELEASE SERIES ARE MADE FROM RIVER CLAY AND TONALLY GLAZED IN GRAPHITE, BROWN, AND GOLD. TANGLED CERAMIC SNAKES INHABIT THE VACANT VESTIGES OF A MASK-LIKE FORM, BOTH COMPLICATING THE SURFACE AND THE IDENTITY OF THE SUBJECT PRESENTED. THE FLUCTUATING SURFACE SUSPENDS A TANGLED MOTION AND APPEARS AS BOTH COMING AND GOING. THE SUBJECT’S ARRIVAL, SIMULTANEOUSLY ANNOUNCED AND FROZEN, RECALLS THE SYMBOLIC POTENCY OF THE SERPENT THROUGHOUT TIME. NAMED BY THE ARTIST AS MARY, MARY OF EGYPT, MARY OF THE VALLEY, OR MARY OF THE LAND AS WE FOREVER TRY TO CLAIM IT, THIS COLLAPSED MYTHOLOGICAL MASK SIGNALS HER RETURN AND RESCUE FROM A HISTORY THAT SOUGHT TO FORGET HER. MARY OF EGYPT IS THE PATRON SAINT OF FLESH AND DESIRE, SHE WAS A WOMAN OF STRONG CONVICTIONS WHO LOVED LOVE, LIFE, AND THE DESERT. POPULARLY IN HER DEPICTIONS, MARY OF EGYPT PILLARS FORTH EVOKING SELF-PRESERVATION AS BRUTALITY, LEAVING A MISUNDERSTOOD LEGACY, WHICH IN REALITY WAS A MUTUAL REJECTION BETWEEN HER CORPOREAL-SELF AND THE WORLD. EXILE WAS HER OWN DECISIVE ACTION. THROUGH THE DESERT, SHE ADOPTS A LIFE OF SCARCITY, ESCAPING A MATERIAL WORLD THAT SHE NO LONGER NEEDS TO ‘KNOW,’ IN FAVOR OF WHAT SHE COULD LEARN OR FIND IN A CAVE, BY ROCK, OR ALONG A RIVER. IN LIFE SHE WAS A CORPSE, IN DEATH SHE BECOMES IMMACULATE. HER FORLORN FIGURE ENDURES AS AN EMBLEM FOR LOVE AND PEACE AND FORGIVENESS, AND FURTHER POSSIBILITY TO BOTH CHOOSE AND REJECT THE WORLD FOR WHICH WE LIVE IN. OVER TIME HER WEATHERED FLESH LAYERS AS HER ENVIRONMENT SO THAT, THE DESERT, IN TURN, BECOMES HER FLESH––A HYBRID SURFACE THAT CONVEYS THE ACCUMULATION OF CONTACT A BODY WEARS THROUGH TIME. IF MANY WOMEN OVER TIME WERE COMPRESSED INTO THE ROLE OF ONE MARY, THEN MARY TOO CAN BE MANY AS WE TRY AGAIN TO MEET HER AND BY DOING SO, SPEAK THROUGH HER.

FOR HER THREE-DIMENSIONAL WORKS, FAY RAY COMPILES CAST ALUMINUM OBJECTS, BORED VOLCANIC ROCKS, WIRE, CHAIN, AND NATURAL MATERIALS INTO SUSPENDED SCULPTURAL MASSES.
RAY’S DUNES 2 HONEYCOMB (2018) CENTERS UPON IDEAS OF SERENITY AND CHAOS. REMINISCENT OF A WIND-CHIME, A FEMININE TRINKET DESIGNED TO MAKE SOOTHING SOUNDS OUT OF THE TURBULENT BREEZE, THIS ARCH-SHAPED SCULPTURE FEATURES TWO SIZABLE SILVER CHAINS WITH A SLAB OF HONEY ONYX DANGLING AT EACH END. THIS VARIETY OF MINERAL ECHOES THE SURFACE OF VENUS IN COLOR AND SWIRLING DESIGN. WHILE THIS PLANET DEDICATED TO THE GODDESS OF LOVE MAY SEEM TEMPERATE AND PARADISIACAL, THE VIEWER KNOWS THAT THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE.

INDRIKIS GELZIS
INDRIKIS GELZIS NEW BOND STREET LONDON THESE ARE HARD LINES. THEY BREAK UP SPACE AND DELINEATE GEOMETRIC FORMS WHOSE MEANINGS WE CAN ONLY ASSUME. WE USE MINIMALISM NOW TO THINK ABOUT SYSTEMS—IT’S NO LONGER JUST A MATTER OF REDUCTION, OF PARING BACK TO THE CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF A MEDIUM OR MATERIAL, SO MUCH AS GENERATING A PROGRAM OR MAP, A SET OF DATA POINTS FROM WHICH SOME FORM OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION MIGHT BE PREDICTED OR INFERRED. GELZIS MAKES THESE WORKS DIGITALLY, 3D-MODELING THE SCULPTURES BEFORE RENDERING THEM IN STEEL TUBES AND FABRIC SLEEVES. THIS PROCESS—AND THE FACT THAT THE FINISHED WORKS LOOK A BIT LIKE HYPERACTIVE STOCK MARKET GRAPHS—MIGHT ALLUDE TO NEOLIBERAL CAPITALISM’S IMPULSE TO ACCUMULATE INFORMATION-AS-WEALTH (THINK, FOR EXAMPLE, OF THE NOVEL AND EXCITING MEANS FACEBOOK INNOVATES TO PROFIT OFF ITS USERS’ DATA). THROUGH IT, THE ARTIST BOTH MATERIALLY CONSOLIDATES AND ABSTRACTS INFORMATION INTO PAINTINGS AND/OR SCULPTURES THAT APPEAR TO MAP SOME SORT OF DATA BUT FLIPPANTLY REFUSE LEGIBILITY.»

SHE ASSEMBLES CONTRASTING NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL ELEMENTS INTO SCULPTURAL ENTITIES USING MATERIALS SHE IS DRAWN TO FOR THEIR FUNCTIONAL OR PROVISIONAL ATTRIBUTES. THE REPURPOSING OF FOUND OBJECTS FROM THE SCIENTIFIC AND MILITARY INDUSTRIES TO FORM LARGER EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS MARKS A DIVERGENCE WITH HER USE OF EPHEMERA SUCH AS OPEN FLAME, VARIOUS SCENTED COMPONENTS, HEAT AND SAND AS WELL AS UNALTERED NATURAL OBJECTS LIKE GIANT CLAM SHELLS. REPETITION, MODULARITY, SYMMETRY AND ADAPTABILITY ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF HER WORK. HER COMBINATIONS OF TACTILE MATERIALS AND SENSORY ENGAGEMENT OFTEN RECALL ALLUSIONS TO SCIENCE FICTION OR THE ALCHEMICAL PROCESSES OF MUTATION AND REGENERATION.
SHE STUDIED AT THE ALBERTA COLLEGE OF ART AND DESIGN, AND LATER AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY, EARNING HER MFA IN 2010. SHE HAS HAD RECENT SOLO EXHIBITIONS AT THE DORTMUNDER KUNSTVEREIN IN GERMANY, STORM KING ART CENTER IN NEW WINDSOR, NEW YORK AS WELL AS AT THE NEW MUSEUM, NEW YORK, HANNAH HOFFMAN GALLERY, LOS ANGELES, ANDREA ROSEN GALLERY, NEW YORK, VENUS OVER LOS ANGELES, LOS ANGELES, GALERIE RODOLPHE JANSSEN , BRUSSELS, RAMIKEN CRUCIBLE, NEW YORK AND THROUGH THE BELLWETHER OFF-SITE PROJECT OF THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART, AMONG OTHERS.

CAMILLA REYMAN
CAMILLA REYMAN PARIS PARFUM ST HONORÉ
"YOU SAID THAT THE ONLY THING THAT MADE...#2" PAPER, BURNT, GREEN EARTH, EPOXY
CAMILLA REYMAN IS BORN IN 1981 IN DENMARK. SHE LIVES AND WORKS IN COPENHAGEN. SHE GRADUATED FROM THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF FINE ART IN 2013.
CAMILLA REYMAN WORKS WITHIN THE FIELDS OF ABSTRACT PAINTING, SCULPTURE AND INSTALLATION ART DRIVEN BY A CURIOSITY OF THE POSSIBLE AGENCY OF MATTER. THE IDEA THAT MATERIALS AND OBJECTS CAN POTENTIALLY BE PERCEIVED AS ENTITIES WITH A RADICAL NON-HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS HAS LONG PREOCCUPIED REYMAN. REYMAN’S SCULPTURE ARE ALL CHARACTERISED BY THE FACT THAT THE MATERIALS THEY ARE MADE OF ARE EMBEDDED IN ECOLOGY AND NATURE. AMONG SEVERAL SCULPTURAL OBJECTS SITS AN AGAVE PLANT. ITS LEAVES ARE COVERED IN SCAR TISSUE PATTERNS, CARVED BY REYMAN. ON THE WALLS, THERE ARE VARNISHED PANELS IN CLUSTERS OF FOUR. THE PANELS VARY FROM MINIMALISTIC AND MONOCHROME WORKS TO EXPRESSIVE ABSTRACTIONS AND SIMPLE GEOMETRIC STATEMENTS. UNDERNEATH THE MANY LAYERS OF TRANSPARENT AND GLOSSY EPOXY VARNISH ARE ORGANIC MATERIALS SUCH AS BURNT BONE AND EARTH PIGMENTS. THE STRONG EPOXY VARNISH CONSERVES REYMAN’S COMPOSITIONS OF POROUS MATERIALS, AND THUS FUNCTIONS AS A SORT OF INDUSTRIAL AMBER, WHICH ENCASES AND PERPETUATES A PERISHABLE AND UNCONTROLLABLE MATERIAL. REYMAN RESIDED FOR TWO MONTHS WITH THE KUNA PEOPLE IN PANAMA WHERE SHE EXPERIENCED THEIR VIBRANT AND DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SURROUNDING ECOSYSTEM. SHE SAW HOW THIS CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WAS INCLUDED IN THEIR EVERYDAY CUSTOMS WHERE ECOLOGY, MATERIALITY AND SPIRITUALITY WERE INEXTRICABLY LINKED. THE SMALL NUCHUS FIGURES MADE OF CLAY, FOUND BY THE RIVER OR IN THE JUNGLE, WERE USED TO WARD OFF EVIL SPIRITS, AS WAS THE RED PIGMENT FROM THE ACHIOTE TREE WHICH WAS SMEARED ON CHEEKS DURING CEREMONIES OR USED AS SEASONING IN FOOD. THE WOMEN EMBROIDERED GEOMETRIC SHAPES ON THEIR CLOTHES SINCE GEOMETRY WAS CONSIDERED A LANGUAGE OF GODS.

MARIE LUND
MARIE LUND NEW BOND STREET LONDON MONTENAPOLEONE MILAN MARIE LUND (B. 1976, DENMARK) IS A GRADUATE OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF ART IN LONDON, WHERE SHE IS CURRENTLY BASED. MARIE LUND’S PRACTICE POETICALLY EXPOSES IMPRINTS AND REACTIONARY FORCES AS SHE EXPLORES THE PLACE AND MOMENT OF INTERSECTION WHERE DIFFERENT OBJECTS MEET THE EXTERNAL WORLD. WORKING BETWEEN SCULPTURE AND INSTALLATION, LUND USES A VARIETY OF MATERIALS SUCH AS TEXTILES, FOUND OBJECTS, CEMENT, WOOD, COPPER AND OTHER NATURAL MATERIALS. LUND THOUGHTFULLY MANIPULATES THESE ELEMENTS, AS THE PHYSICAL TRACES OF HER PROCESS ARE LEFT VISIBLE FOR US TO FIND IN THE FORMS SHE CREATES. LEADING US DOWN A PATH OF NEW EXPERIENCES AND NEW PERCEPTIONS, SHE DRAWS OUT THE SUBLIME FROM THE ORDINARY. IN SO DOING, MARIE LUND’S WORKS HAVE A DISTINCTLY ATMOSPHERIC QUALITY ABOUT THEM, AS IF THE DICHOTOMIES BETWEEN FORM AND CONTENT, INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL, THE BODY AND THE MATERIAL, WHICH ARE EXPLORED IN HER WORK CAN BE FELT THROUGHOUT THE SPACE. IT IS WITHIN THIS TANGIBLE FEELING THAT LUND INVITES US TO EXPLORE, SHOWING US A WORLD WHICH HAS THE SENSATION OF BEING, AT THE SAME TIME, BOTH FAMILIAR AND UNEXPECTED.

Policies and Practices
CELINE’s commitment is to act with integrity in all its business dealings and to promote ethical conduct to enhance compliance with applicable law and to provide guidance with respect to business conduct. CELINE has a number of policies that are relevant to this commitment, which set out what CELINE expects from its employees, internal business and its external suppliers.
Key policies are:
CELINE expects its suppliers to share its commitments and to act in full compliance with all applicable laws, including all national, local and international laws relating to the management of their businesses.
CELINE requires its suppliers to seek approval before subcontracting any part of their supply chain process and CELINE’s approval is subject to acceptance by the subcontractor of the Suppliers’ Code of Conduct and such other conditions that CELINE determines.
The CELINE Code of Conduct includes relevant sections on “Honesty & Ethical Conduct”, “Compliance with Laws & Regulations”, “Safe Working Conditions” and “Sales & Commercial Transactions”.
Our anti-modern slavery policy reflects our commitment to act ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking are not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.
CELINE expects its employees and suppliers to engage in and promote honest and ethical conduct, comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in their own area and act responsibly, with due care, competence and diligence when dealing with colleagues, customers, suppliers, agents and intermediaries.

Supplier and Contractor Due Diligence
CELINE has been carefully reviewing its suppliers and a lot of its suppliers are carefully chosen for the entire group by LVMH.
Moreover, a new procedure has been put in place prior to engaging in any new contractual relationship with a supplier or contractor. CELINE requires suppliers and contractors to satisfy us that they are complying with the Suppliers’ Code of Conduct.

Upon reasonable request, CELINE suppliers and contractors must improve and correct any deficiency discovered during any such audits.
CELINE shall use its reasonable endeavours to ensure that all CELINE supplier and contractor template contracts contain clauses requiring CELINE’s suppliers and contractors to adopt similar anti-modern slavery standards and practices.
Training and Awareness
CELINE is planning to conduct regular training for its employees to ensure legal and human compliance across CELINE. The training enables CELINE to reduce business risk of non-compliance through efficient processes and reliable data and reporting. All documentation, policies and updates are available to all employees.

DAVID ADAMO
DAVID ADAMO PARIS FRANCOIS 1ER "UNTITLED", 2015 WESTERN RED CEDAR "UNTITLED (VESSEL)", 2014 SPRAY PAINT ON WESTERN RED CEDAR
A PROCESS OF SLOW REMOVAL IS CENTRAL TO ADAMO’S SCULPTURE. OBJECTS FROM EVERYDAY LIFE TAKE ON NEW FORMS, REVEALED BY THEIR REMAINS: THE FRUIT AFTER IT HAS BEEN BITTEN, THE BALLOON AFTER THE AIR HAS RUN OUT. THESE REMNANTS ARE CAST IN VARIOUS MATERIALS, INCLUDING BRONZE, PLASTER, AND ALUMINUM. THE SAME IS TRUE OF ADAMO’S WOOD WORKS—THE EVENTUAL FORMS HAVE EMERGED THROUGH THE REDUCTION OF MATERIAL. IN 2011 ADAMO EXHIBITED IN A MEDIEVAL CHURCH, THE BASILICA OF SANTA MARIA MAGGIORE IN BERGAMO, ITALY. HE WAS ALLOWED TO TAKE AN UNUSED OAK BEAM FROM THE BAROQUE RENOVATION OF THE CHURCH. SINCE THEN, WOOD HAS BEEN HIS MATERIAL OF PREDILECTION FOR CONCEIVING AN ENTIRE BODY OF MONUMENTAL SCULPTURES—TOTEM-LIKE COLUMNS, A COLOSSAL CANOE, AMONG OTHERS. THE TOTEM-LIKE COLUMNS ARE TRULY GREAT EXAMPLES OF THIS INTERPLAY OF MASS AND ABSENCE, AN IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC OF HIS WORK. HIS APPROACH TO THE MATERIAL IS SIMPLE, ELEGANT, AND INDUSTRIOUS ALL IN ONE. THE SCULPTURE, UNTITLED, 2012—A TWISTED COLUMN—HAS AN ADDITIONAL SENSE OF TENSION AND MOVEMENT WHILE PRESERVING ITS ICONIC APPEARANCE. AS FOR THE FULLY COVERED IN ROOFING NAILS TOTEM, UNTITLED, 2016, IT’S A RARE EXAMPLE IN HIS WORK, THE HARSH MATERIAL LOOKING LIKE A PROTECTIVE ARMOR FOR THE WOOD UNDERNEATH. BORN IN ROCHESTER, NEW YORK IN 1979, DAVID ADAMO HAS LIVED AND WORKED IN BERLIN SINCE 2008. RECENT EXHIBITIONS INCLUDE SOLO EXHIBITIONS AT ALBRIGHT-KNOX ART GALLERY, BUFFALO, NEW YORK (2015), MENDES WOOD, SÃO PAULO (2013), MD 72, BERLIN (2013), BIELEFELDER KUNSTVEREIN (2012), IBID PROJECTS, LONDON (2012), AND BASILICA DI SANTA MARIA MAGGIORE, IN BERGAMO (2011). THE ARTIST HAS ALSO PARTICIPATED IN MANY SIGNIFICANT GROUP EXHIBITIONS, INCLUDING THE DOMESTIC PLANE: NEW PERSPECTIVES ON TABLETOP ART OBJECTS, THE ALDRICH CONTEMPORARY ART MUSEUM, RIDGEFIELD, CONNECTICUT (2018-2019), SOME SCHOOLS ARE CAGES AND SOME SCHOOLS ARE WINGS, MUSEU DE ARTE DO RIO, RIO DE JANEIRO (2014-2015), MATERIAL WORLD AT DENVER ART MUSEUM (2013), BASED IN BERLIN ORGANIZED BY THE KW INSTITUTE FOR CONTEMPORARY ART, BERLIN (2011), NO SENSE OF PLACE AT BERGEN KUNSTHALL, NORWAY (2011), THE WHITNEY BIENNIAL, NEW YORK (2010), AND GREATER NEW YORK AT MOMA P.S.1, NEW YORK (2010). 24 RUE FRANÇOIS 1ER 75008 PARIS LOCATE THE STORE

BRASS, FELT, BRONZE, COAL, PITCH, BEE’S WAX, BEEF CASING, CRAFT PAPER, COFFEE SIEVES AND WOOL ARE USED INDISCRIMINATELY. THE ARTIST IS LESS CONCERNED WITH BRASS, FELT, BRONZE, COAL, PITCH, BEE’S WAX, BEEF CASING, CRAFT PAPER, COFFEE SIEVES AND WOOL ARE USED INDISCRIMINATELY. THE ARTIST IS LESS CONCERNED WITH THE ORIGINS OR THE POTENTIAL SYMBOLIC VALUE OF EACH OF THE ITEMS THAN WITH THEIR PHYSICAL PRESENCE. EXPERIMENTING WITH THE TEXTURE, WEIGHT AND BALANCE OF HER MATERIALS, SHE CREATES AN EXTREMELY DELICATE VISUAL LANDSCAPE THAT, BY FRUSTRATING ANY ATTEMPT AT INTERPRETATION, IS HIGHLY INTRIGUING. EACH COMPOSITION IS A UNIQUE ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIALS. FELT AND LOOMS ARE HANDMADE AND TAILORED TO THE ARTIST’S CHOICES, COFFEE SIEVES BEAR THE SCARS USE AND TEAR AND NO TWO SHEEPSKINS ARE EVER THE SAME. BOSQUÊ FOCUSES ON THE TRANSIENCE OF MATTER AND IMPERMANENCE. HER USE OF TIME AND SPACE AND HER SCULPTURE VOCABULARY REMIND US OF THE FRAGILITY OF THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT SUSTAIN EVERYTHING WE CONSIDER PERMANENT OR FINAL.

ARTUR LESCHER
ARTUR LESCHER NEW YORK SOHO "CARDENAL", 2019 STAINLESS STEEL
ARTUR LESCHER WAS BORN IN SÃO PAULO/SP, BRAZIL, 1962, WHERE HE LIVES AND WORKS.
FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS, LESCHER PRESENTS A SOLID WORK AS A SCULPTOR, WHICH RESULTS FROM A RESEARCH AROUND THE ARTICULATION OF MATERIALS, THOUGHTS AND FORMS. IN THIS SENSE, THE ARTIST HAS ON THE PARTICULAR, UNINTERRUPTED AND PRECISE DIALOGUE WITH BOTH ARCHITECTONIC SPACE AND DESIGN, AND ON HIS CHOICE OF MATERIALS, WHICH CAN BE METAL, STONE, WOOD, FELT, SALTS, BRASS AND COPPER, FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS TO HIGHLIGHT THE POWER OF THIS DISCOURSE.
EVEN IF LESCHER'S WORK IS STRONGLY LINKED TO INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES, ACHIEVING EXTREME REFINEMENT AND RIGOR, HIS PRODUCTION DOES NOT HAVE THE FORM AS THE ONLY PURPOSE, ACTUALLY, IT GOES BEYOND IT. THIS CONTRADICTION OPENS SPACE FOR MYTH AND IMAGINATION, ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF HIS MINIMAL LANDSCAPE [GALERIA NARA ROESLER, 2006]. BY CHOOSING NAMES FOR HIS ARTWORKS, SUCH AS RIO MÁQUINA, METAMÉRICO OR INABSÊNCIA (PROJETO OCTÓGONO ARTE CONTEMPORÂNEA, PINACOTECA DO ESTADO DE SÃO PAULO, 2012) LESCHER PROPOSES AN EXTENSION OF THE WORK, SUGGESTING A NARRATIVE, SOMETIMES CONTRADICTORY OR PROVOCATIVE, THAT PLACES THE SPECTATOR IN A HIATUS, IN A SUSPENDED CONDITION.

KATINKA BOCK
KATINKA BOCK PARIS DUPHOT
"VELVET COLUMN" CERAMIC
USING CLAY, NATURAL, AND FOUND MATERIALS, AND MORE RECENTLY BRONZE, KATINKA BOCK (FRANCE, BORN GERMANY 1976) CREATES SCULPTURES AND INSTALLATIONS THAT EXPLORE TEMPORALITY AND SPACE, AND THAT ALSO MINE THE TERRITORIES OF HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY. WHILE OFTEN DEALING WITH NATURAL ALTERATION PROCESSES, OR FILMING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF SCULPTURAL ELEMENTS, SHE CREATES A CONTINUOUS MOVEMENT BETWEEN OUTDOOR AND INDOOR SPACES, THE EXHIBITION SPACE AND THE PRODUCTION SITE.
THE WORK OF KATINKA BOCK IS INVESTIGATING THE MATERIAL CONDITIONS THROUGH A DIFFERENT RANGE OF MEDIA: FROM SCULPTURE AS A CENTRAL POINT, BUT ALSO USING FILM, PHOTOGRAPHY AND PUBLISHING. HER WORK DEALS WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT LANGUAGE, COMMON SPACE AND SHARING. SHE ARTICULATES VOCABULARY OF FORMS AND EFFECTS: CLAY, CERAMIC, TEXTILES, FLOW OF LIQUIDS, STRAPS AND WEBBING, FRUIT AND OTHER FICKLE MATERIALS, ARTICULATED TOGETHER SOMETIMES IN PRECARIOUS AND VULNERABLE SITUATIONS, SOMETIMES THEY APPEAR SOLID AND READY TO ENDURE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. HER SCULPTURES ARE THE RESULT OF AN EVENT, SOMETIMES CONTRADICTORY TO THE USED MATERIAL. EACH OF THESE INSTALLATIONS DEFINES A SPACE AND OFTEN SEEMS TO WRESTLE AGAINST THE CLAUSTROPHOBIA OF THE EXHIBITION SPACES, TENDING TO OPEN DOORS, WINDOWS, WALLS, HOLES BY WHICH TO ESCAPE, OR TO LET IN RAIN OR AIR.
BOCK STUDIED AT THE KUNSTHOCHSCHULE IN BERLIN AND AT THE ECOLE NATIONALE DES BEAUX-ARTS OF LYON. SHE WAS AN ARTIST-IN RESIDENCE AT VILLA MEDICIS IN ROME, AND WAS AWARDED WITH THE DOROTHEA VON STETTEN KUNSTPREIS IN GERMANY, THE PRIX RICARD IN FRANCE AND THE PRODUCTION PRIZE OF FUNDACION BOTIN IN SPAIN. SHE HAS HAD SOLO EXHIBITIONS A.O. AT CULTURGEST, LISBON, PORTUGAL; KUNSTMUSEUM STUTTGART, AND NUREMBERG KUNSTVEREIN GERMANY; MAMCO, GENEVA AND KUNSTMUSEUM LUZERN, SWITZERLAND; HENRY ART GALLERY, SEATTLE, USA. HER UPCOMING SOLO PROJECTS WILL BE ON HOLD AT KUNSTMUSEUM WINTHERTUR, MUDAM LUXEMBOURG, IAC VILLEURBANNE MERCER UNION, TORONTO AND COMMUN GUILD IN GLASGOW. 4 RUE DUPHOT 75001 PARIS LOCATE THE STORE

ASGER DYBVAD LARSEN
ASGER DYBVAD LARSEN NEW BOND STREET LONDON OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, ASGER DYBVAD LARSEN HAS HAD HIS PRIMARY FOCUS ON PAINTING, ITS ART HISTORICAL BALLAST AND AN EXPLORATORY APPROACH TO THE PROCESSING OF THE TRADITIONAL MATERIALS OF PAINTING. THUS, IN HIS WORK PRODUCTION THERE ARE CLEAR REFERENCES TO ICONIC ARTISTIC WORKS AND CURRENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, HE WORKS WITH ACRYLIC CASTING OF PAINT TRAYS, THUS CREATING A DIRECT FORMALISTIC LINK TO FRANK STELLA’S STRIPED GEOMETRIC WORKS. WHEN USING THE PAINT TRAY AS AN IMAGE, HE ALSO CONNECTS TO HIS OWN PRACTICE IN THE STUDIO, WHERE HIS PROCESS IS BASED ON CONTINUOUS PRODUCTION AND DESTRUCTION OF WORKS. IT IS AN OPEN PROCESS IN WHICH THE WORKS THAT HE IS WORKING ON ARE IN CONSTANT FLUX. THEY ARE CUT UP AND PUT TOGETHER IN NEW WAYS, THEY GET APPLIED MATERIAL AND ARE TORN APART AND SEWN TOGETHER AGAIN. THE CHARACTERISTIC OF ASGER DYBVAD LARSEN’S PRODUCTION THUS BECOMES HIS PROCESS, WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL WORK BECOMES AN IMAGE OF THE CONSTANT ARTISTIC EXCHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT, RATHER THAN IT BECOMES A WORK FOR ITSELF. THE STUDIO ACTS AS AN ARCHIVE WHICH HE CAN FLIP BACK AND FORTH IN, AND WHERE HE CAN SEPARATE, COMPOSE AND CONSTRUCT NEW CONTEXTS FROM INDEPENDENT WORKS, PROCESSES AND THOUGHTS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THIS ARCHIVE IS IN CONSTANT MOTION AND DEVELOPMENT, AND THEREFORE THE INDIVIDUAL WORKS APPEAR AS SNAPSHOTS OF THE ARTISTIC JOURNEY THROUGH THE TIMES AND PLACES OF THE ARCHIVE. HE DENOTES HIMSELF AS A; «... POWERLESS ARCHIVIST FOR THE INDIGENOUS FAMILY TREE WHOSE BRANCHES I CONSTANTLY BREAK OFF AS PROOF THAT THE STRUCTURE REALLY EXISTS».

NEW YORK SOHO "UNTITLED", 2018 PLYWOOD
LOS ANGELES RODEO DRIVE "UNTITLED", 2017 EASTERN RED CEDAR, BLACK WALNUT, STEEL AND MASONRY TWINE VIRGINIA OVERTON'S WORK COMPRISES INSTALLATION, SCULPTURE AND PHOTOGRAPHY, OFTEN BEGINNING INTUITIVELY AS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO HER PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN A PARTICULAR SPACE. THROUGH A PROCESS OF TRIAL AND ERROR, SHE CREATES SCULPTURE THAT IS PERFORMATIVE, SOMETIMES OBSTRUCTING, BISECTING, DIVIDING OR JOINING THE ARCHITECTURE OF A SPACE WITH WORKS THAT ARE DRAMATIC AND MINIMAL IN FEEL.
INFUSED WITH AN ETHOS OF ECONOMY, OVERTON'S PRACTICE FAVORS ELEMENTAL MATERIALS, FREQUENTLY RECYCLED OBJECTS THAT ARE FOUND ON SITE OR THINGS DISCOVERED IN THE ENVIRONS OF THE EXHIBITION SPACE. MORE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH ARCHITECTURE, CONSTRUCTION WORK OR FARMING, MATERIALS SUCH AS WOOD, METAL, PLEXI AND FLUORESCENT LIGHTING ARE CUT, BENT AND HAMMERED INTO WORKS THAT EVINCE THE POWER AND SENSORY QUALITY OF THEIR OWN MATERIALS. ‘I LIKE FOR THE WORK TO ACT AS A MARKER OF ITS OWN HISTORY – LETTING ACCRUED DEFECTS SHOW IN THE PIECES – THAT TALKS ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MATERIALS HAVE BEEN USED’, SHE EXPLAINS. IN THE WORK UNTITLED (JUNIPERUS VIRGINIANA) (2013), OVERTON USED CEDAR PLANKS FROM HER FAMILY FARM IN TENNESSEE TO NEATLY LINE THE GALLERY WALL, CREATING AN INSTALLATION THAT OPERATED VISUALLY, SPATIALLY AND SENSORIALLY SINCE THIS DISTINCTIVE WOOD HAS A REMARKABLE GRAIN AND COLOUR AS WELL AS A HIGHLY EVOCATIVE SMELL. FOR A RECENT LARGE-SCALE OUTDOOR SCULPTURE COMMISSIONED BY THE STORM KING ART CENTER IN UPSTATE NEW YORK, OVERTON CREATED A 500-FOOT BRASS TUBE WHICH STRETCHES OUT, LIKE A LINE IN SPACE, ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE. DELICATELY RAISED ON STRUTS ABOVE THE GRASS THAT GROWS BENEATH IT, THE TUBE CARRIES AMBIENT SOUND AND IS DESIGNED TO COLOR AND PATTERNATE OVER TIME AS ITS MATERIAL RESPONDS TO THE CHANGE IN WEATHER AND THE SWIFT PASSING OF SEASON. 67 WOOSTER ST NEW YORK, NY 10012

PAUL GEES WAS ONE OF THE KEY ARTISTS TO CONFRONT AND RENOVATE THE PRODUCTION OF SCULPTURE IN BELGIUM, INTRODUCING INTO IT A SENSE OF PRECARIOUS INSTABILITY AND EPHEMERALITY THAT REFLECTED THE VERY SOCIAL RESTLESSNESS OF THE CULTURAL MILIEU IN THE WAKE OF THE 1968 STUDENT UPRISINGS. WAS ONE OF THE KEY ARTISTS TO CONFRONT AND RENOVATE THE PRODUCTION OF SCULPTURE IN BELGIUM, INTRODUCING INTO IT A SENSE OF PRECARIOUS INSTABILITY AND EPHEMERALITY THAT REFLECTED THE VERY SOCIAL RESTLESSNESS OF THE CULTURAL MILIEU IN THE WAKE OF THE 1968 STUDENT UPRISINGS. PAUL GEES IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY SCULPTORS IN BELGIUM. HE TOOK PART IN INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP EXHIBITIONS. WORKS BY PAUL GEES ARE INCLUDED IN MANY PUBLIC COLLECTIONS SUCH AS THE FLEMISH COMMUNITY, BRUSSELS (BE), STAATSGALERIE STUTTGART [GRAPHIC SAMLUNG] (DE), M HKA, ANTWERP (BE) AND MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, BRUSSELS (BE). IN ASSIGNMENT HE PLACED A LARGE NUMBER OF WORKS IN THE PUBLIC SPACE.
A MONOLITHIC WOODEN VOLUME OPERATES HERE AS AN IMAGINARY COMPACTED SCULPTURAL MASS. OPEN VERSUS CLOSED, INSIDE VERSUS OUTSIDE ARE CALLED UP BY THE USE OF MASSIVE AND BENDABLE ASH WOOD. THE MASS AND THE VOLUME BECOME, AS IT WERE, PRESSED OPEN BY A STONE PEG. THE ASH WOOD BENDS AND MAKES THIS TENSION VISIBLE. THE DEPLOYMENT OF ROUGH STONE ACTS AS A SYMBOL FOR NATURE AND FORCE AND MAINTAINS THE PRESSURE ON THE ENCLOSING MATTER.
ANNE LIBBY
ANNE LIBBY NEW BOND STREET LONDON BORN IN 1987, LOS ANGELES, CA LIVES AND WORKS IN LOS ANGELES, CA. INSPIRED BY THE VISUAL SEDUCTION OF THE INDUSTRIAL SUBLIME, ANNE LIBBY’S WORK CREATES UNEXPECTED NEW FORMS BY SUBVERTING AND REINTERPRETING THE SIGNS AND SYMBOLS OF POWER AND CONTROL CREATED BY CONTEMPORARY CORPORATE SPACE. SKYSCRAPERS, GLASS CURTAIN WALLS, CIRCUIT BOARDS, HIGHWAY INTERCHANGES AND OTHER URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE ARE CANNIBALIZED AND REPURPOSED IN HER FREESTANDING SCULPTURES AND HYBRID WALL WORKS. LIBBY’S PROCESS BEGINS AS A DISSECTION OF INDUSTRIAL AND HOUSEHOLD MATERIALS — SURFACES OF PLASTIC FURNITURE ARE PEELED AWAY TO A CLEAN GRID OF HOLLOW BITS THAT REINFORCE STRUCTURE. THE ORNAMENTAL ASPECTS OF LIBBY’S WORK RECALL THE BIOMORPHIC TENETS OF ART NOUVEAU. LIBBY’S HIGHLY SPECIFIC MATERIAL CHOICES SUCH AS ALUMINUM, CERAMIC, AND POLYESTER SATIN GIVE FORM TO HER INTEREST IN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE MAN-MADE AND THE NATURAL WORLD. SEEN TOGETHER, LIBBY’S ARCHITECTONIC WORK CREATES AN IMMERSIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT REFLECTS THE DIZZYING AND SPECTACULAR EFFECTS CREATED BY OUR TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED SOCIETY, FORESHADOWING OF UTOPIAN, OR POSSIBLY DYSTOPIAN, LANDSCAPES THAT MIGHT AWAIT US IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE.

LUKAS GERONIMAS
LUKAS GERONIMAS MILAN SANTO SPIRITO – CLOSED STORE "GATE POSTS", 2018
LUKAS GERONIMAS (B.1980, TORONTO, CANADA, LIVES AND WORKS IN LOS ANGELES, CA) EMPLOYS PAINSTAKING ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CRAFT TO CREATE OTHERWORLDLY SCULPTURES THAT CALL INTO QUESTION PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS OF MATERIALITY AND USEFUL FORM. HIS WORK OFTEN CONTAINS FOUND OR GIFTED MATERIAL THAT IS OBSESSIVELY RECONDITIONED TO BECOME UNRECOGNIZABLE FROM ITS ORIGINAL STATE. IT IS THROUGH THIS ALCHEMICAL PROCESS THAT HIS FORMS FIND MEANING
'GATE POSTS' ARE A CUSTOM MODIFICATION TO A PAIR OF FOUND DOUGLAS FIR BLOCKS. THE DIMENSIONS OF THE BLOCKS WERE NOT ALTERED, THEY WERE MERELY CAPPED AND INLAYED WITH HAND-POLISHED ALUMINUM. THE CUSTOM MODIFICATION IS MEANT TO CHARGE THE OBJECTS WITH HUMANE ENERGY. THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO 'POSTS' IS CONSIDERED A GATEWAY - WHILE PASSING THROUGH THIS SPACE, A BODY IS TRAVERSING A VOLUME WITHIN WHICH THE ARTWORK HAS A PHYSICAL AGENCY. SO, WHEN YOU WALK BETWEEN THESE TWO OBJECTS, YOU ARE PASSING THROUGH A CONTEXTUALLY-CHARGED SPACE. WHAT LIES ON EITHER SIDE IS DETERMINED BY THE ENVIRONMENT INTO WHICH THE ARTWORK HAS BEEN PLACED. IT COULD BE THE SAME, OR DIFFERENT.
CHARLES HARLAN
CHARLES HARLAN NEW YORK SOHO "TREE", 2018 WOOD, STEEL
CHARLES HARLAN IS A BROOKYN-BASED ARTIST WHO USES OBJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH INDUSTRY AND LABOR SUCH AS STEEL PIPES, STONE, WHEELBARROWS, AND FISHING BOATS AS READYMADE SCULPTURAL OBJECTS. THESE EVERYDAY ITEMS ARE GIVEN NEWFOUND AESTHETIC VALUE, UNDERMINING GIVEN CONVENTIONS OF WHAT EXACTLY CONSTITUTES A WORK OF ART. OUTSIDE OF THEIR ORIGINAL CONTEXTS, THESE INDUSTRIAL OBJECTS CONJURE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR ORIGINS AND THE CIVILIZATIONS THAT HAVE RELIED ON THEM. CHARLES HARLAN WAS BORN IN 1984 IN THE SOUTHERN STATE OF GEORGIA, WHERE HIS MOTHER OWNS A HARDWARE STORE. HARLAN GREW UP WITH AN APPRECIATION FOR BASIC TOOLS, BUILDING MATERIALS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO HUMANITY. RECENT SOLO EXHIBITIONS INCLUDE TIF SIGFIDS IN ATHENS, GEORGIA, THE ATLANTA CONTEMPORARY, ALSO IN GEORGIA, KAYNE GRIFFIN CORCORAN IN LOS ANGELES, JTT IN NEW YORK, CARL KOSTYÁL IN LONDON, UK, RODOLPHE JANSSEN IN BRUSSELS, AND PIONEER WORKS IN NEW YORK.

WORKING WITH VIDEO, INSTALLATION AND PHOTOGRAPHY, MA MINES, BENEATH THE DRASTIC SOCIAL-CULTURAL TRANSFORMATIONS, IN THE EMOTIONAL DEPTH OF THE PEOPLE’S MEMORY. HER NARRATIVES ARE OFTEN AUTOBIOGRAPHIC, BUT THEY ARE ALWAYS DEEPLY INTERTWINED WITH THAT OF “WOMAN” AS A COLLECTIVE, IN BOTH FAMILIAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXT. AN OVERARCHING THEME IN MA’S WORKS IS THE INTERGENERATIONAL GAPS, AS SHE OFTEN INJECTS HER ART WITH SYMBOLS OF THE SOCIOCULTURAL TRANSFORMATIONS DURING THE SEVERAL RECENT HIGH-SPEED DECADES. HER "WONDERLAND" SERIES THAT MA BEGAN WORKING ON SINCE 2014. IT IS COMPRISED OF SMASHED CEMENT SLABS OF THE SAME MODEL WRAPPED IN NYLON STOCKINGS IN DIFFERENT SHADES, WHICH ARE THEN REATTACHED INTO NEW BLOCKS. THE COLORFUL STOCKINGS WERE ACCEPTED BY A YOUNGER GENERATION IN THE 80S AND 90S. WHEN PRODUCING THE WORKS, MA USED CLEAR NAIL POLISH TO PATCH THE SNAGS AND TEARS ON THE STOCKINGS—THE PRECISE WAY IN WHICH HER MOTHER USED TO FIX HER STOCKINGS IN A TIME FAR BEFORE THE UBIQUITY OF OVERPRODUCTION. THE BODY AS A BOTH PRIVATE AND COLLECTIVE ENTITY, THE MEMORY AND TEXTURE OF AN INTIMATE OBJECT WORN NEXT TO THE SKIN, AND THE AESTHETICS OF HER GENERATION INTERWEAVE AND MEET IN THIS WONDERLAND.

JAMES BALMFORTH
JAMES BALMFORTH NEW YORK MADISON "SURFACE RESPONSE (STACK)", 2019 STAINLESS STEEL, MILD STEEL, SLAG JAMES BALMFORTH’S WORKS ARE THE OUTCOME OF AN ONGOING EXPLORATION AND NEGOTIATION WITH MATERIALS, PROCESSES AND TRANSFORMATION. HE EMPLOYS INDUSTRIAL TECHNIQUES AND MECHANICAL APPARATUS TO EXPOSE MATERIALS TO FORCES SUCH AS EXTREME PRESSURES OR HEAT, EVOKING MATERIAL EXPRESSIVITY. WITH A VARIETY OF METHODS AND TOOLS, BALMFORTH PUSHES MATERIALS TO THEIR PHYSICAL LIMITS AND REVEALS THRESHOLDS, MARGINS OF TOLERANCE, MOMENTS OF TRANSFORMATION AND THEIR RESULTANT FORMS OR OUTCOMES.
HIS PRACTICE USES SCULPTURE AND SCULPTURAL PROCESSES TO DRAW OUT THREADS OF MATERIAL PROPERTIES AND CAPABILITIES, EXPLORING SYMBOLIC MECHANISMS AND HOW THESE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO OUR IDEAS ABOUT HISTORY AND SOCIETY. PREOCCUPIED WITH NOTIONS OF LIMITATION, THRESHOLDS AND DEGRADATION, BALMFORTH’S MANAGEMENT OF SUBJECT AND MATERIAL FOCUSES ON THE BREAKING POINTS IN A SYSTEM, MATERIAL OR PROCESS AND POINTS TOWARDS THE CONSTRUCTIVE OUTCOMES OF CREATIVE ANARCHY AND DESTRUCTION. BY REVEALING THE REDEMPTIVE POTENTIAL IN COLLAPSE AND DEGRADATION, THE ARTIST SEES HIS WORK AS EXPOSING A LATENT POTENTIAL, OFFERING AN OPTIMISTIC, RATHER THAN FATALISTIC, WORLDVIEW. 650 MADISON AVE NEW YORK, NY 10022

EM ROONEY IS A POSTWAR & CONTEMPORARY ARTIST WHO WAS BORN IN 1983. HER WORK WAS FEATURED IN NUMEROUS EXHIBITIONS AT KEY GALLERIES AND MUSEUMS.
THIS WORK IS PART OF AN ONGOING SERIES OF WORKS BASED ON GIFT GIVING, INSPIRED BY VARIOUS HISTORIES OF GIFT GIVING IN ARTIST’S PRACTICES INCLUDING MOYRA DAVEY’S MAIL WORKS AND LUTZ BACHER’S BIRD’S NEST WORKS. BEFORE THE STORM (FOR CHRIS) IS ONE OF FOUR RELATED WORKS WHICH INCLUDE A BRACELET AND TWO PHOTOGRAPHIC WORKS IN ADDITION TO BEFORE THE STORM (FOR CHRIS). EM BEGAN THE WORK BY MAKING TWO COPIES OF THE BRACELET, A TYPE OF CHARM BRACELET WHICH INCLUDES LETTER-FORMS, A FROG’S LEG AND A FLOWER CAST IN PEWTER. ONE BRACELET WAS GIVEN TO HER HUSBAND, THE ARTIST CHRIS DOMINICK, AND THE OTHER BECAME A WORK IN THE GROUPING. THE FOUR WORKS RELATE LOOSELY TO CHRIS HIMSELF, REFERENC- ING NUMEROUS DETAILS CHRIS AND THE TIME EM SPENDS WITH HIM. THE PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE GROUP WERE TAKEN AT GUILDER POND NEAR THEIR HOME IN WEST STOCKBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS. THE TITLE OF BEFORE THE STORM (FOR CHRIS) COMES FROM AN IRIS OF THE SAME NAME WITH DEEP PURPLE, NEARLY BLACK PETALS, A PERRENIAL BULB THAT GROWS EXTENSIVELY ON THE PROPERTY THEY LIVE. THE WORK IS CONSTRUCTED OF A WELDED STEEL SKELETON WHICH CONTAINS PETALS MADE FROM VARIOUS SCULPTURAL MATERIALS HELD IN PLACE WITH BLACK LEATHER.

LUISA GARDINI PARIS PARFUM ST HONORÉ
"SENZA TITOLO" MIXED MEDIA, WOOD
LUISA WAS BORN IN RAVENNA (ITALY) IN 1935. SHE STARTED STUDYING PAINTING IN HER HOME TOWN AND THEN ENROLLED AT THE ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS IN ROME. EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS BEEN PROLIFICALLY PRODUCING WORKS THROUGH DIFFERENT MEDIA SINCE THE END OF THE 50S - INCLUDING DRAWING, PAINTING, COLLAGE, SCULPTURE AND FOUND OBJECT - SHE ONLY STARTED EXHIBITING AT THE END OF THE 70S.
LUISA GARDINI’S FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH CONTEMPORARY ART HAS BEEN TOTI SCIALOJA WHO INTRODUCED HER TO THE INTERNATIONAL ARTISTIC CONTEXT OF THE ’50 - ’60 AND TO THE WORKS OF MASTERS SUCH AS CY TWOMBLY AND MARK ROTHKO. LUISA GARDINI’S PRACTICE, INSPIRED BY THESE LESSONS, IS ALWAYS CHARACTERIZED BY A QUICK AND INSTINCTIVE SIGN, BY DISTORTION AND SERIALITY: SIGN AND MATTER ALWAYS PLAY THE LEADING ROLE. IN HER WORKS THERE IS NO DESIRE TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OR SPECULATIVE, THEY ARE RATHER A CONTINUOUS RESEARCH ON THE POTENTIAL OF ALL THE POSSIBLE FORMS OF AN OBJECT, HER ART IS REPRESENTATIVE OF AN INTIMATE INSTINCT THAT CANNOT BE OTHERWISE DECIPHERED. ANOTHER CRUCIAL ELEMENT OF HER ART IS THE USE OF THE MATTER AND THE BLENDING OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES: WE CANNOT ALWAYS SEPARATE SCULPTURE FROM PAINTING DUE TO THE THE STRATIFICATION OF MATERIALS, OBJECTS, IMAGES, ILLEGIBLE TEXTS WHICH CAN TRANSFORM BOTH THE MATTER AND THE SHAPE, RESULTING IN AN INDECIPHERABLE OBJECT. 390 RUE SAINT-HONORÉ 75001 PARIS

DANIEL JENSEN
DANIEL JENSEN NEW BOND STREET LONDON
BORN 1972, MALMÖ. LIVES AND WORKS IN STOCKHOLM
DANIEL JENSEN´S SCULPTURES, PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS OFTEN EXPLORE ISSUES OF CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY AND NATURE IN DECLINE. THE WORKS DEAL WITH SUBJECTS LIKE ALIENATION, FAILURE AND TRANSFORMATION. A PATCHWORK OF REFERENCES AND TECHNIQUES ALONG WITH MYTHS GIVES LIFE TO A SERIES OF CHARACTERS AND A PERSONAL UNIVERSE. THIS UNIVERSE HAS THE SEMBLANCE OF A DEPRAVED FAIRYTALE WHERE HUMOUR AND DEEP SINCERITY ARE ENTWINED AND UNCONSTRAINED, PLACING THE SPECTATOR IN AN ODD STATE OF LAUGHTER AND CONTEMPLATION. JENSEN ALTERNATES BETWEEN THE FIGURATIVE AND THE ABSTRACT WHERE THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY NARRATIVE SENSE. IN HIS RECENT WORKS THE VOLATILE MOMENT IS LIFTED, WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY IN THE BACKGROUND HAS NOW BEEN MOVED FORWARD.

"APORÍA IV", 2017 ONE WAY MIRROR, SANDSTONE AND VOLCANIC ROCK JOSE WAS BORN IN GUADALAJARA, MEXICO, 1974 LIVES AND WORKS IN GUADALAJARA, MEXICO.
JOSE DÁVILA’S WORK, NURTURED BY HIS ARCHITECTURE FORMATION, MAKES CONSTANT REFLECTIONS ON MODERN ARCHITECTURE AND URBANISM, CONTEMPORARY ART, ITS FORECASTS AND FAILURES. WITH REFERENCES SUCH AS ARCHITECTURAL UTOPIAS OR MILESTONES IN TWENTIETH CENTURY ART, DÁVILA APPROACHES THE VITAL CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN FORM AND FUNCTION. HIS HYBRID STRUCTURES CAN BECOME COLD OR WARM, LIGHT AND HEAVY, PRODUCING SIGNS OF FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCERN, AND WHOSE MEANING VARIES BETWEEN ARCHITECTURE AND ART. HUMOR, MELANCHOLY AND A SENSE OF LOSS ARE NOTIONS EXPRESSED BY THE ARTIST THROUGH ELEMENTAL FORMS AND MATERIALS, REFERENCING THE WORK OF KEY ARTISTS AND ARCHITECTS IN THE HISTORY OF ART. BY APPROPRIATING THE SERIES "HOMAGE TO THE SQUARE" BY JOSEF ALBERS, DONALD JUDD’S "STACKS", OR CUTTING OUT THE FIGURE OF YVES KLEIN JUMPING TO THE VOID OR PIERO MANZONI SIGNING THE BACK OF ONE HIS "LIVING SCULPTURES", DÁVILA REFLECTS ON THE DEFINITION OF CONCEPTUAL ART THAT STATES THAT IT IS THE CONTENT AND NOT THE FORM WHAT GIVES IMPORTANCE AND MEANING TO A WORK OF ART. 650 MADISON AVE NEW YORK, NY 10022 LOCATE THE STORE
BANKS VIOLETTE
BANKS VIOLETTE CELINE ART PROJECT
EVERY ERA HAS ITS DEFINING FIGURES, AND IN THE CONDENSED NEW YORK ARTWORLD OF THE EARLY AUGHTS, BANKS VIOLETTE WAS FOREMOST AMONGST THEM. OF THE MANY CURRENTS RUNNING THROUGH THAT SCENE, VIOLETTE’S WAS THE DARKEST AND MOST STRINGENT. BROKEN DRUM-SETS, SKELETAL ARCHITECTURES AND VACATED STAGES SPLINTERED BY SHARDS OF WHITE, FLUORESCENT LIGHT AND SET TO THE SUBSONIC UNDERTOW OF DEATH METAL’S SOCIETAL ANGST CAPTURED THE ZEITGEIST OF AN ERA’S PRECARIOUS BALANCE OF NIHILISM AND CELEBRATION. DRAWING FROM MUSIC, ART, THEATRE AND FASHION, VIOLETTE’S ART TOOK THE FORM OF A BAROGRAPHIC TRACE RECORDING THE PRESSURE THAT WAS THE SLOW IMPLOSION OF EVERYTHING AROUND IT - PRESSURE THE ARTIST EVENTUALLY SUCCUMBED WITHDRAWING FROM THE WORLD HE’D HELPED DEFINE.
DRAWN TO THE INCANDESCENT ENERGY OF THAT MOMENT, HEDI SLIMANE WAS BOTH DOCUMENTARIAN AND PARTICIPANT IN THIS SEMINAL NEW YORK MOMENT. HIS STARK BLACK AND WHITE IMAGES OF THE ARTISTS PERFECTLY CAPTURED THE TAUGHT MASCULINITY AND ABSOLUTE ABANDON OF HIS ARTIST PEERS. IN JULY OF 2007 HE CURATED A GROUP SHOW TITLED “SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH”, AT ARNDT & PARTNER IN BERLIN, FEATURING THE WORKS OF ARTISTS DASH SNOW, SLATER BRADLEY, MATHEW CERLETTY, DAN COLEN, GARDAR EIDE EINARSSON, TERENCE KOH, DOUGLAS KOLK, NATE LOWMAN, RYAN MCGINLEY, MATT SAUNDERS, STEVEN SHEARER, PAUL P., AND BANKS VIOLETTE. LATER THAT YEAR, “YOUNG AMERICAN” AT THE FOAM FOTOGRAFIEMUSEUM IN AMSTERDAM, PAID PHOTOGRAPHIC TRIBUTE TO THE SAME GENERATION OF ARTISTS.
AFTER THE BEST PART OF A DECADE SEQUESTERED IN UPSTATE NEW YORK, VIOLETTE HAS BEGUN A CAUTIOUS RE-ENGAGEMENT WITH THE WORLD HE LEFT BEHIND. WITH THE INDELIBLE LEGACY OF THAT EARLY PERIOD MORE RELEVANT THAN EVER, VIOLETTE’S WORK IS REAPPEARING IN GALLERIES, MUSEUMS AND NOW IN THE CONTEXT OF SLIMANE’S RE-IMAGINING OF THE CELINE FLAGSHIP STORES. THE SYNERGY BETWEEN ARTIST AND DESIGNER HAS BEEN LONGSTANDING. “THE THING THAT I’VE ALWAYS ADMIRED ABOUT HEDI IS THAT EVEN WHEN THE APPROACH IS DECONSTRUCTED, THERE ISN’T ANY CRITICAL REMOVE OR DETACHMENT. THERE’S A GENUINE SINCERITY TO HIS INVESTMENT IN THE THINGS HE ADMIRES. AS A RESULT, HE CAN TRANSFORM SOMETHING THAT IS PERMANENTLY FRAMED AS IRONIC INTO ITS OPPOSITE.”
THE CHANDELIER STRUCTURES CREATED FOR THE STORES, ARE CLASSIC VIOLETTE. THE REPEATED MODULAR FORMS TAKE THE MINIMALIST FRAMEWORKS OF DAN FLAVIN OR SOL LE WITT AND PUSHES THEM INTO A DECONSTRUCTED STATE OF THEATRICAL COLLAPSE. VIOLETTE LIKENS THEM TO A FIGURE WHO HAS STUMBLED AND FALLEN. THEY ARE AN IMAGE OF OVERDOSE, EQUAL PARTS NARCOTIC COLLAPSE AND NARCAN REVIVAL. “I RELATE TO SCULPTURE AS THIS THING THAT EXTENDS ITSELF INTO THE SPACE OF A BODY SO IT’S OF NECESSITY ANTHROPOMORPHIZED – AND SO AUTOBIOGRAPHICALLY I WAS LIKE YEAH I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT...” THE RESULTING SCULPTURES PERFECTLY CAPTURE THE EMOTIONAL TENOR OF THE TIMES: “IT’S AS IF ARISTOTLE WAS RAISED IN A WARZONE WHICH HE PROBABLY WAS, AND THE POETICS OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER MEET THE AESTHETICS OF BOREDOM.” ADD TO THAT FASHION AND RETAIL, AND THE MEETING IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER.

DAVINA SEMO
DAVINA SEMO PARIS MONTAIGNE "WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE", 2016 POWDER-COATED STEEL CHAIN
DAVINA SEMO’S (B. 1981, WASHINGTON, DC) WORKS REFERENCE A POST-INDUSTRIAL WORLD THAT IS DISQUIETING YET INCONTROVERTIBLE. USING MATERIALS SUCH AS ONE-WAY MIRRORS, CHAINS, SAFETY GLASS, REINFORCED CONCRETE AND SPRAY PAINT, DAVINA SEMO SCULPTURES OFFER, AS THE CRITIC BOB NICKAS HAS POINTED OUT, ‘A DISTANCED AND IMPLIED VIOLENCE’, WHILST ALSO BEING ‘CAPABLE OF PURE POETIC GESTURE.
THIS CHAIN PIECE IS FROM AN ONGOING SERIES OF WALL-SCULPTURES THAT ENGAGE MONOCHROMATIC PAINTING AND THE TRADITION OF THE SHAPED CANVAS. INSTEAD OF TRADITIONAL MATERIALS, DAVINA USES ROUGH AND TOUGH PAINTED CHAINS AS THE CHROMATIC ELEMENT. THIS ALLOWS FOR SUBTLE PATTERNING AND DIMENSIONALITY BUT ALSO SPEAKS TO HER INTEREST IN INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS AS A METAPHOR FOR POWER AND CONTROL. IN SHORT, SHE’S ALWAYS RIDING THE LINE BETWEEN BRUTALITY AND ELEGANCE. THE TITLES OF THESE WORKS ARE POETIC SNIPPETS OF LANGUAGE TAKEN FROM POLITICIANS, ACTIVISTS, LITERATURE, AND ACT AS A COUNTERPOINT TO THE BLUNT FACT OF THE MATERIALS. 53 AVENUE MONTAIGNE 75008 PARIS

THE SØREN SEJR PAINTING 'COMP. BLACK OPEN BOTTOM' IS FROM HIS "FORMAL BLACK" SERIES PAINTINGS HE STARTED IN 2017. IN THESE PAINTINGS SEJR IS BREAKING THROUGH THE MONOTONE BLACK SURFACE BY LETTING A PART OF THE PAINTING STAND OPEN WITH ITS RAW CANVAS AND SCRIBBLED ABSTRACT LINES. THE INCISTING BLACK TOP OF THE PAINTINGS SUGGESTS THAT ITS COVERING UP THE MORE INTUITIVE SCRIBBLING PARTS AND THEREFOR DOMINATING THE SURFACE. CONTROLLING THE NARRATIVE. IT'S A STRUGGLE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARK, NIGHT OR DAY THAT IS THE CORNERSTONE OF THIS PAINTING BY SØREN SEJR. 384 RUE SAINT-HONORÉ 75001 PARIS LOCATE THE STORE
