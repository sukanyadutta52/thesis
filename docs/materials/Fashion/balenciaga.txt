In loving memory of Danielle Slavik. Few figures have left as lasting an impression on Balenciaga as Danielle Slavik, model for Cristóbal Balenciaga from 1964 to 1968 and close friend of the House. Danielle was meant to walk in our 54th Couture Collection last week. Danielle first returned to Balenciaga in 2022 for the 51st Couture show, connecting past and present with her enduring elegance. She was known for her kindness and the warmth she shared with everyone, especially the Couture atelier, with whom she remained close until her last days. We extend our condolences to her family and loved ones. Danielle’s legacy will forever remain a part of Balenciaga’s history.

Archive For Balenciaga Music
On November 20th, 2023, Balenciaga will launch the next phase of Balenciaga Music, offering a 360° experience and articulated access to participants by utilizing innovative formats. “Music is a big part of my life and is an integral part of Balenciaga’s culture,” says artistic director Demna. “Balenciaga Music was created to share my favorite musical artists and their personal tastes and influences. We have now expanded this project to give a more personal and complete music experience with exclusive content and interactive technology. To kick off this new chapter, we selected Archive, who made an 8.5-minute exclusive track, ‘Patterns,’ and a 7-hour playlist, each especially for Balenciaga.” Archive’s 28-year history involves 12 studio albums that span electronic, trip-hop, post- and progressive rock. For Balenciaga Music, the English group have composed “Patterns,” a song only available via an NFC (Near Field Communication) chip that is made in a limited edition and embedded in tags that are sewn into Balenciaga Music | Archive merchandise.

ARCHIVE PLAYLIST
FOR BALENCIAGA
Once the merch is purchased, wearers may scan the chip with a smartphone, unlocking an original listening event. These interactive garments—T-shirts and hoodies that list Archive’s full discography, in white with red lettering or black with white lettering—will be available in selected Balenciaga stores worldwide and on balenciaga.com. “Patterns” marks a first for each entity involved: Archive have never collaborated with a fashion brand; Balenciaga has never premiered music via product. In addition to the exclusive track, Archive have hand-selected a 7-hour playlist meant to be played on shuffle. It populates a new Balenciaga Music hub on balenciaga.com that links to multiple streaming services, offering access from almost anywhere in the world. “Balenciaga has always stood for individuality and innovation,” says founding Archive member Darius Keeler, “qualities that we’ve always tried to keep at the heart of Archive’s creative process, too. So, when the opportunity came along to collaborate on this exciting project, it seemed like a perfect fit. I think the track that we’ve created is something very special.” This project expands the scope of Balenciaga Music, which has consisted of dedicated playlists and accompanying merch, by introducing entirely new music that was created and recorded with Balenciaga audiences in mind, as well as a technically advanced merch series, through which this music can be accessed.

Aya Nakamura For Balenciaga Music
On March 17th, 2022, an exclusive playlist by Aya Nakamura for Balenciaga was released to stream and download on Apple Music. Launching simultaneously, limited-edition Balenciaga x Aya Nakamura merchandise was in stores and on Balenciaga.com. Aya has broken and re-broken records in terms of music streaming with her chart-topping tracks, garnering her titles like most-watched, most-played, most-viewed, and most important French singer in Europe right now by the press and major platforms. For Balenciaga, she has selected a list of songs that have inspired, influenced, and enthralled her throughout her life.
Accompanying this playlist was a limited-edition unisex Balenciaga line of clothing and accessories created in the tradition of concert merch. To announce the collaboration, a campaign of videos and photographs show fans wearing the merch and holding homemade signs while in line for autographs. As an official curator on Apple Music, Balenciaga selects artists to create original playlists. Tracks are chosen by the selected artist, who is chosen by Demna himself. Demna started off the series with his own playlist and followed that with one by American drag queen RuPaul.

Jay-Jay Johanson For Balenciaga Music
From November 11th, 2023, an original, 30-song playlist by Jay-Jay Johanson is available to stream via Balenciaga Music. For the first time, the tracks populate a dedicated page on balenciaga.com that links to multiple streaming platforms simultaneously, offering access from almost anywhere. Jay-Jay Johanson is a Swedish singer-songwriter who has released 14 studio albums that experiment with melodic, melancholic, and ethereal sounds, traversing electronic genres. His playlist is a collection of favorites, longtime influences, and new inspirations.
Accompanying Jay-Jay’s Balenciaga Music mix is a series of collages created in collaboration with Christophe Brunnquell, who in 2017 created a video for Jay-Jay's song “Bury the Hatchett” by transposing the singer’s facial features onto printed self-portraits in surrealistic ways. For the new images, new portraits of Jay-Jay were taken, and the concept was recreated using a similar technique. Balenciaga Music selects artists to create original playlists based on their personal tastes, giving audiences a window into their processes and backgrounds. These artists are chosen by Demna, who started off the series with his own mix, followed by collaborations with RuPaul, Aya Nakamura, Acid Arab, Pink Martini, and more.

Artists whose work has greatly inspired Demna throughout his life are invited to share their own musical universes with personal references and music they themselves enjoy listening to. “The Balenciaga x Apple Music playlists will be by some of my favorite music artists, each of whom I have personally selected,” said Demna about the new endeavor. “These playlists will represent their personal tastes and influences, giving insight into what they listen to in their own lives. “To launch the project, I decided to release my own playlist, including some favorite tracks that I listen to every day. This playlist is a musical introduction and representation of me. This is why it is called Hello, My Name Is Demna.”

You may not always be required to provide us with the personal information that we are asking you for: any personal information that is required is clearly marked as mandatory.
When you do not wish to share certain personal information with us, you may simply not provide it to us, or opt-out of the processing of your personal information when this option is offered to you.
However, if you choose not to provide certain personal information, you may not be able to benefit from some of our services or to purchase certain products for which the provision of such personal information is necessary.
We may ask you to provide us with personal information to meet certain legal requirements.

Our general approach is to retain your personal information only for as long as it is needed.
When you have a Balenciaga profile, a temporary record or subscribe to our newsletters, we generally retain your personal information for 5 years from the last interaction you initiated with us.
When you interact with our customer services, we generally retain the recordings of the calls for 40 days (unless a longer retention period is permitted by law), and the other personal information you have shared with us (including personal information shared by mail, chat or text message or when our interaction is transcribed) for 5 years from the last interaction you initiated with us.
We may retain personal information for a shorter or longer time, for instance, where we are obliged to do so in accordance with relevant legal, tax and accounting requirements.
Last interaction shall be defined as the last contact you initiated which is traceable by our systems or by a sales associate. Last c ontact could be the last time a call, sales email, or meeting was proposed to you and to which you responded favorably . F or instance, c licking on a link included in an email (except for a link to unsubscribe from receiving marketing content) , having a chat on our w ebsite or attending an appointment in one of our stores are considered a l ast c ontact . Conversely , o pening an email or visiting our website without logging in would not qualify as l ast c ontact.
Before delet ing your personal information from your Balenciaga or temporary record , we will contact you to inform you of such deletion and you may ask us to keep your personal i nformation . By not answering you agree to the deletion of any personal information that we are not legally obliged to keep for longer in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements.
We will delete or destroy your personal information without delay once it is no longer necessary (e.g., if the purposes of collection/use of the personal information have been accomplished, if the statutory retention period expires) in a way that prevents such personal information from being restored or recovered. If printed on paper, the personal information will be destroyed by shredding, incinerating, or some other similar method and, if saved in electronic form, the personal information will be destroyed by technical methods which ensure that the personal information cannot be restored or recovered thereafter.
In specific circumstances we may also retain your personal information for longer according to the applicable statute of limitations so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges.
It is also possible that certain information which we consider to be important for Balenciaga history or patrimony may be retained by us for longer periods exclusively for archival purposes, for historical purposes or for statistical purposes. This may be the case when some of our notable customers have benefited from our services or bought our products.

In this context, please be aware that we use personal identification information, such as your email address or phone number, to link an interaction or a purchase with your Balenciaga profile. This also applies when checking-out as a guest on our website when making a purchase , as mentioned above, or in case you bind your social media open ID account with your Balenciaga profile (by using dedicated QR Codes for example).

Subject to your applicable privacy legislation you may have the right to have your information rectified at any time, and in event please let us know if any of your information needs updating or correcting, and we will make our best efforts to detect and correct inaccurate personal information (data cleansing) and delete any duplicated dataset. This may require us to correct typographical errors or inconsistent personal information.
You should have the same unified experience no matter how we communicate. Whether this happens in our stores, on our website, by chat, by phone or by video, and whether you contact us or we contact you , we want to provide you with relevant and tailored customer service.
We will use the information we have about you to try to identify you when you contact us (whether by phone, video chat, text message , chat, social media, etc.). When we can identify you, we will be able to access personal information available in your Balenciaga profile or in your temporary record , to know when you have previously interacted with us and to provide you with the tailored assistance you are asking for. This could include real-time or subsequent monitoring of your interaction with us (for example on our website or in a store) to identify the products you are looking at or what could be your specific need.
To provide you with adequate customer service, you may be asked if you need further assistance when you are on our website or in a store. On our website, if you do not want to be contacted, kindly close the chat navigation window. This service was implemented for you to enjoy the same service as in one of our physical stores.

All our customers are important to us. However, some of our customers and potential customers benefit from a more personalized experience due to the important relationship they keep with Balenciaga . Our teams may need to collect and gather information on such customers or potential customers in order to identify personalities who correspond to the image and values of Balenciaga to offer them unique support. This may be the case when you participate in one of our selective projects or when our Sales Associates offers you to participate in events or contacts you for certain special occasions (for your birthdays or for a particular event of your life).
Our communications will be customised and specifically designed to be of interest to you, and will be updated with any new personal information linked to your Balenciaga profile. We will thus use your personal information to send you tailored communications or other customised advertisements or marketing campaigns. This use of your data includes some profiling activity.

This is why w e will use your personal information to send you tailored communications or personalise your journey with us, but only with your prior consent where it is required under applicable privacy legislation . Our communications could include tailored product recommendations we think you might like, personali s ed marketing content designed to suit your interests, personali s ed events invitations or, at your request and where available, personali s ed and customi s ed products. For these purposes, we will use the information you provide to us (for example your date of birth, your country of residence, your preferred means of contact , etc.) and/or jointly or independently, certain patterns we may observe when interacting with you (for example where you prefer buying our products, what type of products you like, which occasions you a re shopping for , etc.) . With this information , we may create groups of similar customer s (called " persona " ) to w hom we can decide to offer personali s ed content and experiences both in inbou n d or outbound interactions. In this context, we may make inference s about you , as derive d from your personal information ( profiling ). For example, if you always purchase our products from the same store (specif i c location or online), we may consider this store as your preferred one. This will allow us to customi s e your experience with Balenciaga based on your interests and shopping habits ( i.e . tailored communication). In order to provide you with such customised and personalised experience , in our stores or online, you may be required to log in or identify yourself.
To enrich your personal information, w e may use cookies or other online advertising technologies . Via such technologies , we will collect personal information related to your activities on social media and your browsing activity across different websites and devices (for example: to know if you have visited our website after opening a newsletter you have received). Certain technologies may rely on services provided by other companies acting on their own account (such as social media WeChat, WhatsApp, Baidu, Kakao Talk, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram , or other online platforms ). These companies have their own privacy and cookies policies and the way they use the personal information you share with them will be subject to their rules and not ours.
To enrich your personal information, we can match it with personal information held by others (for example, by sharing and matching your information with information held by trusted partners , or by binding your social media open ID account with your Balenciaga profile (by using the dedicated QR Codes for example). This process will only be conducted by using customers' unique identifiers and reidentification protocols in order to protect the confidentiality of your personal information.
Using cookies or other online advertising technologies may also enable us to show you online advertisement s that are " contextual " (meaning they are shown according to the webpage you are browsing ) , or " behavio u ral " or " interest based " (where advertisements are shown to you based on your interests which we have inferred from your information including demographic, geographic and interest-based data ). We may use such advertisements to display products or services that are most relevant to you.
If you no longer want to see customised online advertisements , you may request us to delete your Balenciaga profile or modify your cookie preferences – see " cookies or other online advertising technologies " . In addition, some third -party sites allow you to stop seeing advertisements from specific advertisers, so you may also set your preferences on those websites.
We will never contact you to ask for your password. Please be aware if you receive any request for this personal information.
When, as a user, you decide to interact with our social media pages (e.g. when you follow one of our pages, when you click "Like" on Facebook or "Follow" on Instagram or add a reaction to a post, when you "share" or add a "comment", etc.), we have access to public information in your profile. Your information is used for the purpose of interacting with you through the social network in question or to establish analyzes or statistics on the use of our pages or on the performance of our communications. Our services may remove your comments if they do not comply with our policies on the use of social networks (e.g. if your comments are insulting, illegal or malicious).

To deliver our products and services safely to you, perform our contract properly or comply with some of our legal obligations, we will implement fraud prevention and detection measures. Such measures will allow us to adequately perform our contract with you and/or protect our legitimate interests in defending ourselves against fraud. We may notably implement measures to ensure that you are complying with our terms and conditions for sales, available on this website, offers and programs, and to prevent and detect non-compliance or fraud by you. This may include reviewing and assessing your dealings with us, your eligibility to participate in certain sales, offers and programs, your compliance with the terms and conditions of such sales, offers and programs, and undertaking enforcement action and/or disciplinary action where such non-compliance or fraud is suspected or identified.
We may use administrative and technical measures to protect, our website, our systems, our networks, transactions occurring on our website or in our stores, and any other necessary means to protect the personal information we may access or store.

Such measures may also be implemented for compliance purposes or to avoid sharing your personal information with any untrusted third parties. For example, when you purchase a product, your personal information will be associated with a unique code placed into and/or printed on such product so that by reading the unique code we can recognize the order as yours, to enable us to assess your compliance with our terms and conditions or to detect fraud by you, and to take enforcement and/or disciplinary action against you in the event of suspected or identified non-compliance or fraud by you.
In addition, we may implement certain measures to protect and defend our rights and property, our employees and our business partners in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and international conventions. For example, we can monitor our inbound and outbound interaction with our customer service (including via voice or video recording or listening in real time, with prior notice to you); also, mindful of the health of our employees, and for this sole purpose, we implement an anti-malicious calls procedure so that any occurrence of inappropriate behaviors such as harassment, insults or direct threats from users will be reported to our dedicated team. This will generate a warning to the concerned user and they will be recorded on our provisional list. The initial warning will set out the consequences of a second incident occurring. A second incident will lead to the suspension of any further calls from the user in question for a period of 4 months. During this period, the user will still be able to contact our customer services by other communication channels (e.g., regular mail or email) so we can attend their queries and preserve their rights at any given time.
Certain activities which are required when conducting a business may involve the use of your personal information. This could include internal processes (such as finance control, accounting, stock management, production management, internal or external audit), certain legal obligations (for example, record-keeping or tax declaration ), or analyses conducted in case of a merger or acquisition.
We may also conduct various business - related analytics & market research activities , which may require us to access or otherwise use some of your personal information , or to send you surveys or customer satisfaction questions in order to gather new or additional information .

Acid Arab For Balenciaga Music
On May 2nd, 2022 an exclusive playlist by Acid Arab for Balenciaga was released to stream and download on Apple Music. Launching simultaneously, limited-edition Balenciaga x Acid Arab merchandise was available in stores and on balenciaga.com. Announcing the collaboration was a limited-edition unisex Balenciaga line of clothing and accessories in fluorescent green printed with the words “Acid Arab” in Arabic and Roman lettering. A dedicated campaign of augmented photography by Éamonn Freel accompanied the playlist and merch. Freel has worked on Balenciaga Eyewear and High Summer campaigns in the past.
Acid Arab formed in Paris in 2012 as a music collective, the concept of which was and is to create a space for Arab culture in the world of contemporary electronic music. They tour clubs and festivals worldwide with their blend of Western electronic and Eastern sounds and vocals. As an official curator on Apple Music, Balenciaga selects artists to create original playlists. Tracks are chosen by the selected artist or group, based on their personal tastes and influences. These creators are chosen by Demna, who started off the series with his own playlist, followed by exclusive drops and limited-edition merch from American drag performer RuPaul, and French pop singer Aya Nakamura.

This year, Balenciaga is providing a donation to Outright’s emergency relief fund for the people of Ukraine.
In times of crisis, people at risk of legal and social discrimination may face higher risks and yet are often excluded from relief efforts. Outright provides financial and other types of help, directly and in partnership with local coalitions and groups; for example, advocates for people defending Ukraine who are denied equal civil rights due to their sexual orientation or gender identity and expression. As of April 2023, Outright has distributed over USD $2.7M through more than 113 grants to 39 local LGBTIQ-serving partners in Ukraine providing direct humanitarian aid. Their emergency relief fund is also supporting grassroots LGBTIQ organizations’ basic operating and staffing expenses.

GEORGE V
In 1937, Cristóbal Balenciaga established his Paris ateliers at 10–12 Avenue George V. It was at this historic address that the couturier of couturiers worked, fitted clients, showed collections, and kept an apartment until he retired in 1968.
In 2020, the building was restored to reflect the original Balenciaga interiors, part of a long-term project implemented to preserve the House’s heritage and legacy.
In 2021, artistic director Demna presented the first Balenciaga Couture collection since M. Balenciaga’s last, in the newly reopened Salons de Couture at 10 Avenue George V. The address is now home to the Couture Store, an innovative retail experience where patrons can find one-of-a-kind exclusives.
Previous architectural iterations have been closely considered while renovating the building, originally designed by A.L. Voisvenel in 1887 and decorated by Christos Bellos under the direction of Balenciaga.
In its time, the interior design was by all accounts demure for a Couture House, its neutral tones and features typical of an apartment in the area, chosen so as not to distract from the collections.
For its reopening in 2021, the House’s original off-white stucco arabesques, creaky parquet floors, and warm grey carpets were recreated and patinated to affect the untouched passage of decades. “I decided to replicate the original salons of that time in as much detail as possible,” said Demna, “and in addition to create an authentically aged, dusty effect of the interior, as if the apartments were reopened after over half a century of being abandoned. The notion of time does not exist in couture to me. It is timeless in its effort for an impossible perfection.”

Pink Martini For Balenciaga Music
On September 15th, 2022 an exclusive playlist by Pink Martini for Balenciaga was released to be available to stream and download on Apple Music. Launching simultaneously, limited-edition Balenciaga x Pink Martini merchandise was available in stores and on balenciaga.com. Announcing the collaboration was a dedicated campaign starring Pink Martini fans on a custom stage wearing the limited-edition unisex merch, photographed by Francois Prost.
The hoodies and long-sleeve T-shirts made of 100% organic cotton feature the Pink Martini logo, depicting an airplane circling the world, with the words Balenciaga Music Merch below it, as well as lettering that references the band’s albums Hang On Little Tomato and Je dis oui! (I say yes!), its song Je ne veux pas travailler (I do not want to work), and the cities in which each of the members of Pink Martini were raised. Pink Martini formed in Portland, Oregon in 1994 as an alternative to the way political events were being soundtracked. The “little orchestra” draws inspiration from music all over the world, crossing the genres of pop, classical, and jazz. As an official curator on Apple Music, Balenciaga selects artists to create original playlists. Tracks are chosen by the selected artist or group, based on their personal tastes and influences. These creators are chosen by Demna, who started off the series with his own playlist, followed by exclusive drops and limited-edition merch from RuPaul, Aya Nakamura, and Acid Arab.
