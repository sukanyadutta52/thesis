\chapter{Research Methodology}
\label{ch:methodology}

\initial{T}he empirical investigation of psychological manipulation in marketing discourse presents unique methodological challenges that require careful consideration of both the scale and complexity of contemporary digital marketing. This research employs a mixed methods approach that combines quantitative corpus analysis with qualitative multimodal discourse analysis, enabling systematic pattern identification across large datasets while maintaining the interpretive depth necessary for understanding manipulation mechanisms. The methodological framework developed here addresses fundamental questions about how to identify, categorize, and analyze manipulation strategies that often operate below the threshold of conscious awareness.

\section{Introduction: A Mixed Methods Approach}
\label{sec:method_intro}

This chapter presents the methodological framework employed to investigate psychological manipulation in marketing discourse across fashion, fitness, and skincare sectors. The research adopts a mixed methods approach combining quantitative corpus analysis with qualitative multimodal discourse analysis, enabling both systematic pattern identification and deep interpretive understanding of manipulation mechanisms.

The methodological design addresses three core challenges in studying marketing manipulation. First, the scale challenge: contemporary digital marketing produces vast quantities of text requiring systematic analysis beyond manual capacity. Second, the complexity challenge: manipulation operates through multiple semiotic modes—textual, visual, interactive—requiring integrated analytical frameworks. Third, the detection challenge: sophisticated manipulation strategies often operate below conscious awareness, necessitating analytical tools that reveal hidden patterns and mechanisms.

This mixed methods approach integrates complementary strengths. Quantitative corpus analysis enables pattern detection across large datasets, identifying manipulation frequencies, distributions, and correlations invisible to qualitative analysis alone. Qualitative discourse analysis provides interpretive depth, revealing how manipulation strategies construct meaning and exploit psychological vulnerabilities. The combination produces findings that neither approach could achieve independently—quantitative patterns guide qualitative investigation while qualitative insights inform quantitative categorization.

\section{Research Design and Philosophical Foundations}
\label{sec:design}

\subsection{Critical Realist Paradigm}

This research operates within a critical realist paradigm that acknowledges both objective reality (marketing texts exist independently) and subjective interpretation (meaning emerges through analysis). Critical realism, as articulated by Roy Bhaskar, distinguishes between the empirical (observed events), the actual (all events whether observed or not), and the real (underlying structures and mechanisms). This ontological stratification proves particularly relevant for studying manipulation, which operates through mechanisms that may not be directly observable but produce empirical effects.

The critical dimension addresses power relations inherent in marketing discourse. Following Fairclough's critical discourse analysis tradition, this research examines how marketing texts reproduce and reinforce asymmetric power relationships between corporations and consumers. The methodology doesn't claim neutrality but explicitly adopts a critical stance toward manipulative practices that exploit consumer vulnerabilities.

\subsection{Mixed Methods Integration}

The mixed methods design follows Creswell's convergent parallel model where quantitative and qualitative data collection occur simultaneously, with integration occurring during interpretation. This design suits the research questions that require both breadth (how prevalent are manipulation strategies?) and depth (how do manipulation strategies operate?).

Integration occurs at multiple levels:
- \textbf{Data level}: The same texts undergo both quantitative coding and qualitative analysis
- \textbf{Analysis level}: Quantitative patterns inform qualitative sampling while qualitative insights refine quantitative categories
- \textbf{Interpretation level}: Findings merge to create comprehensive understanding exceeding individual methods

The priority remains equal between methods rather than privileging quantitative over qualitative or vice versa. This balanced approach recognizes that understanding manipulation requires both systematic documentation of patterns and interpretive analysis of meaning construction.

\section{Data Collection and Corpus Construction}
\label{sec:data_collection}

\subsection{Sampling Strategy}

The sampling strategy employed purposive maximum variation sampling to capture diversity within and across sectors. Selection criteria included:

\textbf{Market position}: High-end luxury (Dior, Celine), mid-range (Nike, CeraVe), and mass market (H\&M, Nivea) brands ensure representation across price points and target demographics.

\textbf{Geographic reach}: Global brands (Nike, L'Oreal), regional brands (Gymshark, The Ordinary), and national brands provide geographic diversity.

\textbf{Marketing approach}: Traditional luxury houses (Hermes), digital-native brands (Gymshark), and hybrid models (Nike) capture different marketing philosophies.

\textbf{Sector representation}: Equal distribution across fashion (12 brands), fitness (12 brands), and skincare (11 brands) enables systematic comparison.

The final sample comprises 35 brands:
- \textbf{Fashion}: Nike, Adidas, Zara, H\&M, Gucci, Prada, Dior, Chanel, Hermes, Celine, Uniqlo, Levi's
- \textbf{Fitness}: Nike Training, Adidas Performance, Under Armour, Lululemon, Gymshark, Peloton, ClassPass, F45, CrossFit, Daily Burn, Beachbody, P.volve
- \textbf{Skincare}: L'Oreal, Olay, Neutrogena, Nivea, CeraVe, The Ordinary, Clinique, Estee Lauder, La Mer, La Prairie, Eucerin

\subsection{Data Collection Procedures}

Data collection occurred during October-November 2024, capturing contemporary marketing discourse during a period of heightened commercial activity. Collection procedures ensured systematic, comprehensive, and ethical data gathering:

\textbf{Digital marketing texts}: Website copy, email campaigns, and social media posts were collected using automated scraping tools and manual extraction. All texts were publicly accessible, avoiding password-protected or private content.

\textbf{Temporal sampling}: Data collection spanned 8 weeks to capture temporal variations including seasonal campaigns, product launches, and promotional cycles.

\textbf{Multimodal elements}: Beyond text, visual elements (images, videos) and interactive features (quizzes, customization tools) were documented through screenshots and detailed descriptions.

\textbf{Ethical considerations}: Only publicly available marketing materials were collected. No personal consumer data, private communications, or proprietary information was accessed. The research focuses on brand-generated content rather than user responses.

\subsection{Corpus Characteristics}

The final corpus comprises approximately 4.5 million characters of marketing text, distributed relatively evenly across sectors:
- Fashion: 1.48 million characters
- Fitness: 1.51 million characters  
- Skincare: 1.52 million characters

This substantial corpus enables robust pattern detection while remaining manageable for qualitative analysis. The average text length of 128,571 characters per brand provides sufficient material for identifying recurring strategies while avoiding redundancy.

\section{Analytical Framework and Coding Scheme}
\label{sec:analytical_framework}

\subsection{Development of Coding Categories}

The coding scheme emerged through iterative process combining deductive categories from theory and inductive categories from data. Initial deductive categories derived from Cialdini's influence principles, van Dijk's manipulation characteristics, and Kress and van Leeuwen's visual grammar. Pilot analysis of 10\\% of the corpus revealed additional patterns, leading to refined categories that balance theoretical grounding with empirical emergence.

The final coding scheme comprises two primary dimensions:

\textbf{Manipulation Strategies} (10 categories):
1. \textbf{Temporal Pressure}: Creating urgency through deadlines, limited time offers
2. \textbf{Scarcity Claims}: Asserting limited availability, exclusive access
3. \textbf{Authority Appeals}: Claiming expert endorsement, scientific backing
4. \textbf{Social Proof}: Citing popularity, user numbers, testimonials
5. \textbf{Fear-Based Appeals}: Threatening negative consequences, loss, exclusion
6. \textbf{Aspiration Triggers}: Promising transformation, ideal states, success
7. \textbf{Emotional Blackmail}: Exploiting guilt, shame, obligation
8. \textbf{Scientific Mimicry}: Using technical language, statistics without substance
9. \textbf{Exclusivity Framing}: Positioning as elite, members-only, special access
10. \textbf{Inadequacy Amplification}: Highlighting deficiencies, problems, shortcomings

\textbf{Emotional Triggers} (8 categories):
1. \textbf{Fear}: Anxiety about negative outcomes
2. \textbf{Aspiration}: Desire for positive transformation
3. \textbf{Guilt}: Feeling of moral failure
4. \textbf{Shame}: Sense of personal inadequacy
5. \textbf{Envy}: Desire for others' possessions/status
6. \textbf{Pride}: Satisfaction from achievement/status
7. \textbf{Belonging}: Need for group inclusion
8. \textbf{Urgency}: Pressure for immediate action

\subsection{Coding Procedures and Reliability}

Coding followed systematic procedures ensuring consistency and reliability:

\textbf{Unit of analysis}: The sentence served as primary coding unit, with context considered for interpretation. Each sentence could receive multiple codes reflecting multiple strategies.

\textbf{Coding process}: Initial automated coding using keyword matching and pattern recognition identified potential instances. Manual verification confirmed or rejected automated coding, ensuring accuracy over speed.

\textbf{Reliability measures}: A subset of 10\% underwent independent double-coding, achieving inter-rater reliability of 0.83 (Cohen's kappa), indicating substantial agreement. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and codebook refinement.

\textbf{Quantification}: Raw frequencies were normalized per 10,000 words to enable comparison across texts of different lengths. Intensity scores combined frequency with linguistic markers of emphasis (superlatives, repetition, capitalization).

\subsection{Multimodal Analysis Framework}

Visual and interactive elements underwent parallel analysis using adapted framework from Kress and van Leeuwen's visual grammar:

\textbf{Visual analysis dimensions}:
- Representational: What/who is depicted and how
- Interactive: Gaze, angle, distance relationships with viewer
- Compositional: Information value, salience, framing

\textbf{Interactive analysis dimensions}:
- Affordances: What actions are enabled/constrained
- Feedback: How system responds to user input
- Choice architecture: How options are structured

Visual-textual relationships were categorized as:
- \textbf{Reinforcement}: Visual amplifies textual message
- \textbf{Complementarity}: Visual adds different information
- \textbf{Contradiction}: Visual undermines textual claims

\section{Data Analysis Procedures}
\label{sec:analysis_procedures}

\subsection{Quantitative Analysis}

Quantitative analysis employed multiple statistical techniques to identify patterns and test relationships:

\textbf{Descriptive statistics}: Frequencies, means, and standard deviations documented manipulation strategy prevalence across brands and sectors. Distribution analyses revealed whether strategies clustered or dispersed.

\textbf{Comparative analysis}: Chi-square tests examined whether manipulation strategies differed significantly across sectors. ANOVA tested whether manipulation intensity varied by brand positioning (luxury/mid-range/mass market).

\textbf{Correlation analysis}: Pearson correlations explored relationships between strategies (e.g., do brands using fear also employ scarcity?). Factor analysis identified underlying dimensions organizing manipulation strategies.

\textbf{Pattern detection}: Cluster analysis grouped brands with similar manipulation profiles. Sequential analysis examined strategy combinations and ordering within texts.

Statistical analysis used Python with pandas for data manipulation, scipy for statistical tests, and matplotlib/seaborn for visualization. Significance threshold was set at p < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis}

Qualitative analysis followed Fairclough's three-dimensional framework examining text, discursive practice, and social practice:

\textbf{Textual analysis} examined:
- Vocabulary: Word choices constructing particular realities
- Grammar: Sentence structures encoding relationships
- Cohesion: How texts create coherent narratives
- Text structure: Organization of information and arguments

\textbf{Discursive practice analysis} examined:
- Production: How texts are created (teams, testing, optimization)
- Distribution: How texts reach consumers (channels, targeting)
- Consumption: How texts position readers and invite interpretation

\textbf{Social practice analysis} examined:
- Economic: How texts serve capital accumulation
- Political: How texts maintain power relations
- Cultural: How texts reproduce/challenge social values

Analysis proceeded iteratively, moving between detailed textual analysis and broader contextual interpretation. NVivo software supported systematic coding and retrieval, though interpretation remained fundamentally human rather than automated.

\subsection{Integration and Synthesis}

Integration of quantitative and qualitative findings occurred through systematic comparison and triangulation:

\textbf{Convergence}: Where quantitative and qualitative findings aligned, confidence in results increased. For example, quantitative documentation of fear appeals (248 instances) converged with qualitative analysis revealing fear as universal manipulation strategy.

\textbf{Complementarity}: Where methods provided different insights, fuller understanding emerged. Quantitative analysis revealed fear's prevalence while qualitative analysis explained its effectiveness through evolutionary psychology and loss aversion.

\textbf{Divergence}: Where findings conflicted, further investigation resolved discrepancies. Initial quantitative coding suggested positive messaging dominated fitness marketing, but qualitative analysis revealed that aspirational language masked inadequacy triggers.

\section{Quality Criteria and Limitations}
\label{sec:quality}

\subsection{Ensuring Research Quality}

Multiple strategies ensured research quality across paradigmatic traditions:

\textbf{Validity} (quantitative dimension):
- Construct validity: Coding categories grounded in established theory
- Internal validity: Systematic procedures minimize bias
- External validity: Diverse sampling enables cautious generalization

\textbf{Trustworthiness} (qualitative dimension):
- Credibility: Prolonged engagement with data, member checking with marketing professionals
- Transferability: Thick description enables application to other contexts
- Dependability: Detailed audit trail documents analytical decisions
- Confirmability: Reflexive journal acknowledges researcher positioning

\textbf{Mixed methods quality}:
- Integration: Meaningful combination rather than parallel reporting
- Inference quality: Conclusions warranted by integrated evidence
- Pragmatic utility: Findings applicable to consumer protection

\subsection{Methodological Limitations}

Several limitations warrant acknowledgment:

\textbf{Temporal limitation}: Data collection represents specific temporal moment. Marketing strategies evolve rapidly, particularly in digital environments. Longitudinal research could reveal strategy evolution.

\textbf{Cultural limitation}: Focus on English-language marketing in Western contexts limits cultural generalizability. Marketing manipulation may operate differently in other linguistic and cultural contexts.

\textbf{Reception limitation}: Analysis examines production rather than reception. How consumers actually interpret and respond to manipulation remains outside scope, though critical for complete understanding.

\textbf{Access limitation}: Some marketing occurs through private channels (targeted emails, app notifications) inaccessible to research. Analyzed public marketing may not represent all strategies.

\subsection{Ethical Considerations}

The research adhered to strict ethical guidelines:

\textbf{Data ethics}: Only publicly available marketing materials were analyzed. No deception, no invasion of privacy, no harm to participants since no human subjects were directly involved.

\textbf{Analytical ethics}: Critical stance toward manipulation doesn't imply judgment of individual marketers who may operate within systemic constraints. Focus remains on practices rather than practitioners.

\textbf{Dissemination ethics}: Findings will be shared with consumer protection agencies and advocacy groups. While brands are named, criticism focuses on practices rather than defamation.

\section{Chapter Summary: Methodological Rigor for Critical Investigation}
\label{sec:method_summary}

This methodology chapter has detailed the systematic approach employed to investigate psychological manipulation in marketing discourse. The mixed methods design combines quantitative corpus analysis with qualitative discourse analysis, enabling both pattern identification and interpretive understanding.

Key methodological decisions include:
- Critical realist paradigm acknowledging both material texts and interpreted meanings
- Purposive sampling ensuring diversity across and within sectors
- Substantial corpus (4.5 million characters) enabling robust analysis
- Theoretically grounded yet empirically responsive coding scheme
- Multiple analytical techniques revealing different dimensions
- Quality assurance through reliability testing and triangulation

The methodology balances several tensions inherent in studying marketing manipulation. Systematic documentation requires standardization while contextual understanding demands flexibility. Critical orientation toward manipulation requires analytical distance while understanding effectiveness requires empathetic engagement. Large-scale pattern detection requires automation while meaning interpretation requires human judgment.

This methodological framework enables the empirical analysis presented in subsequent chapters. By establishing rigorous procedures for identifying and analyzing manipulation strategies, the research provides solid foundation for understanding how contemporary marketing systematically exploits consumer vulnerabilities. The mixed methods approach ensures findings are both systematically documented and deeply understood, supporting both academic contribution and practical application to consumer protection.

The following chapters apply this methodology to analyze marketing discourse across fashion, fitness, and skincare sectors, revealing how psychological manipulation operates in practice and identifying both universal patterns and sector-specific variations in exploitation strategies.
